Morning in a Pine Forest

The Morning in a Pine Forest () is a painting by Russian artists Ivan Shishkin and Konstantin Savitsky. The bears were painted by Savitsky, but the art collector Pavel Tretyakov effaced his signature, stating that "from idea until performance, everything discloses the painting manner and creative method peculiar just to Shishkin", so the painting is now credited solely to Shishkin.

The "Morning in a Pine Forest" turned very popular, being reproduced on various items, including the "Clumsy Bear" chocolates by Krasny Oktyabr. According to one poll, the painting is the second most popular in Russia behind "Bogatyrs" by Viktor Vasnetsov. Shishkin's similar paintings are the "Forest in Spring" (1884) and "The Sestroretsk Forest" (1896).

It is believed that Shishkin painted the pine trees near Narva-JÃµesuu in Estonia, where he often liked to rest in summers.
