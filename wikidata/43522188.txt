Golden Summer, Eaglemont

Golden Summer, Eaglemont is an 1889 painting by Australian artist Arthur Streeton. Painted during a summer drought when Streeton was twenty-one years old, it is an idyllic depiction of sunlit, undulating plains in rural Heidelberg on Melbourne's outskirts. Naturalistic yet poetic, and a conscious effort by Streeton to create his most epic work yet, it is a prime example of the artist's distinctive, high-keyed blue and gold palette, what he considered "nature's scheme of colour in Australia". It is one of his most famous works and is considered a masterpiece of Australian Impressionism.

It was painted "en plein air" at an artists' camp established by Streeton at Mount Eagle (now Eaglemont), where he and other Australian Impressionists occupied an old weatherboard house. Streeton described the location in a letter to fellow painter Tom Roberts, which he calls "our hill of gold":

It was the first painting by an Australian-born artist to be exhibited at both the Royal Academy in London, in 1890, and the Paris Salon the following year, where it was displayed with the title "Golden Summer, Australia", and won an award. One critic noted the popularity of "Golden Summer, Eaglemont" with "the crowds that throng the Salon", saying that it was "simply impossible" to pass by the painting "as it is utterly different from any other picture in the vast collection".

It was acquired by Scottish shipbuilder Charles Mitchell and remained part of his estate for several years until Streeton bought the painting back.

Ahead of its auction in Australia in 1924, Lionel Lindsay extolled the work in the hope that it would enter a public gallery:

It was acquired by a private collector for 1,000 guineas, then a record for a painting by an Australian artist. It broke the same record in 1995 when it was purchased by the National Gallery of Australia for $3.5 million.
