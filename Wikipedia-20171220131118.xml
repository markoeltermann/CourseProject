'''''The Heart of the Andes''''' is a large [[oil-on-canvas]] [[landscape painting]] by the American artist [[Frederic Edwin Church]] (1826–1900).

At more than five feet (1.7 metres) high and almost ten feet (3 metres) wide, it depicts an idealized landscape in the South American [[Andes]], where Church traveled on two occasions. Its exhibition in 1859 was a sensation, and the painting established Church as the foremost landscape painter in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;craven&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=American Art: History and Culture|author=Craven, Wayne|year=2002|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|isbn=0-07-141524-6|pages=207–209}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been in the collection of New York's [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] since 1909, and is among Church's most renowned works.

== Background ==
[[File:Humboldt-Bonpland Chimborazo.jpg|thumb|''Alexander von Humboldt and [[Aimé Bonpland]] at the foot of the [[Chimborazo (volcano)|Chimborazo]]'' ([[Friedrich Georg Weitsch]], 1810)]]

In 1853 and again in 1857, Church traveled in [[Ecuador]] and [[Colombia]], financed by businessman [[Cyrus West Field]], who wished to use Church's paintings to lure investors to his South American ventures. Church was inspired by the [[Prussia]]n [[naturalist]] and explorer [[Alexander von Humboldt]], and his 1845 treatise ''[[Kosmos (Humboldt)|Kosmos]]''. Humboldt was among the last of the great scientific generalists, and his fame was similar to that of [[Albert Einstein]] a century later.&lt;ref name=&quot;gardner&quot;/&gt; In the second volume of ''Kosmos'', Humboldt included a chapter on the influence of landscape painting on the study of the natural world—ranking that art among the highest expressions of the love of nature&lt;ref name=&quot;gould&quot;/&gt;—and challenging artists to portray the &quot;physiognomy&quot; of the landscape.&lt;ref name=&quot;gardner&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Scientific Sources of the Full-Length Landscape: 1850|author=Gardner, Albert Ten Eyck |journal=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, New Series|volume=4|date=Oct 1945|pages=59–65|doi=10.2307/3257164|issue=2|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|jstor=3257164}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;butt&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Büttner, Nils|title=Landscape Painting: A History|pages=283–285|publisher=Abbeville Press Publishers|location=New York|year=2006|isbn=0-7892-0902-0|others=trans. Russell Stockman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Church retraced Humboldt's travels in South America.

== Description and influences ==

''The Heart of the Andes'' is a composite of the South American [[topography]] observed by Church during his travels.  At the center right of the mountain landscape is a shimmering pool served by a waterfall. The snow-capped, majestic [[Chimborazo (volcano)|Mount Chimborazo]] of Ecuador appears in the distance; the viewer's eye is led to it by the darker, closer slopes that decline from right to left. The evidence of human presence consists of a lightly worn path that fades away, a hamlet and church lying in the central plain, and closer to the foreground, two natives are seen before a cross. The church, a trademark detail in Church's paintings, is Catholic and Spanish-colonial, and seemingly inaccessible from the viewer's location. Church's signature appears cut into the bark of the highlighted foreground tree at left. The play of light on his signature has been interpreted as the artist's statement of man's ability to tame nature—yet the tree appears in poor health compared to the vivid jungle surrounding it.&lt;ref&gt;Sachs, pp. 99–100&lt;/ref&gt;

Church's landscape conformed to the aesthetic principles of the ''[[picturesque]]'', as propounded by the British theorist [[William Gilpin (clergyman)|William Gilpin]], which began with a careful observation of nature that was then enhanced by particular notions about composition and harmony. The juxtaposition of smooth and irregular forms was an important principle, and is represented in ''The Heart of the Andes'' by the rounded hills and pool of water on the one hand, and by the contrasting jagged mountains and rough trees on the other.&lt;ref name=&quot;poole&quot;/&gt;

The theory of British critic [[John Ruskin]] was also an important influence on Church.
Ruskin's ''[[Modern Painters]]'' was a five-volume treatise on art that was, according to American artist [[Worthington Whittredge]], &quot;in every landscape painter's hand&quot; by mid-century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=John Ruskin and Artistical Geology in America|author=Wagner, Virginia L.|journal=    [[Winterthur Portfolio]]|volume=23|issue=2/3|date=Summer–Autumn 1988|pages=151–167|doi=10.1086/496374|last2=Ruskin|first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ruskin emphasized the scrutiny of nature&lt;!--the importance of scrutinizing nature? &quot;emphasize scrutiny&quot;/&quot;importance of scrutinizing&quot;—indifferent to this --&gt;, and he viewed art, morality, and the natural world as spiritually unified. Following this theme, the painting displays the landscape in detail at all scales, from the intricate foliage, birds, and butterflies in the foreground to the all-encompassing portrayal of the natural environments studied by Church. The presence of the cross suggests the peaceful coexistence of religion with the landscape.&lt;ref name=&quot;craven&quot;/&gt;

== Exhibition ==

[[File:Church Heart of the Andes exhibited.jpg|thumb|220px&lt;!--don't MOS this--&gt;|There is no photographic record of the 1859 exhibition of ''The Heart of the Andes''; its exhibition in 1864 is pictured. The overhanging portraits and handrails were added for its inclusion in the fine art gallery at New York's Metropolitan Sanitary Fair.]]

''The Heart of the Andes'' was first exhibited publicly between April 29 and May 23, 1859 at New York's Studio Building on West 10th Street, the city's first &quot;studio edifice&quot; designed for artists.&lt;ref name=&quot;avery&quot;/&gt; The event attracted an unprecedented turnout for a single-painting exhibition in the United States: more than 12,000 people paid an admission fee of twenty-five cents to view the painting. Even on the final day of the showing, patrons waited in line for hours to enter the Exhibition Room.&lt;ref name=&quot;avery&quot;&gt;Avery (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

The installation of the work was as unique as its dimension and detail. There is no record of the  appearance or arrangement of the Studio Building exhibit. It has been widely claimed, although probably falsely, that the room was decorated with palm fronds and that [[Gas lighting|gaslight]]s with silver reflectors were used to illuminate the painting.&lt;ref name=&quot;avery&quot;/&gt; More certain is that the painting's casement-window–like &quot;frame&quot; had a breadth of fourteen feet and a height of almost thirteen, which further imposed the painting upon the viewer. It was likely made of brown [[chestnut]], a departure from the prevailing gilt frame.  The base of the edifice stood on the ground, ensuring that the landscape's horizon would be displayed at the viewer's eye level. Drawn curtains were fitted, creating the sense of a view out a window. A skylight directed at the canvas heightened the perception that the painting was illuminated from within, as did the dark fabrics draped on the studio walls to absorb light. [[Opera glasses]] were provided to patrons to allow examination of the landscape's details, and may have been necessary to satisfactorily view the painting at all, given the crowding in the exhibition room.&lt;ref name=&quot;avery&quot;/&gt;

Church's canvas had a significant effect on its viewers; a contemporary witness wrote: &quot;women felt faint. Both men and women succumb[ed] to the dizzying combination of terror and vertigo that they recognize[d] as the [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]. Many of them will later describe a sensation of becoming immersed in, or absorbed by, this painting, whose dimensions, presentation, and subject matter speak of the divine power of nature.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;poole&quot;&gt;Poole, Deborah. &quot;Landscape and the Imperial Subject: U.S. Images of the Andes, 1859–1930.&quot; ''Close Encounters of Empire: Writing the Cultural History of U.S.-Latin American Relations.'' Duke University Press: 1998. {{ISBN|0-8223-2099-1}}; pp. 107–138.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accompanying the admission were two pamphlets about the painting: [[Theodore Winthrop]]'s ''A Companion to The Heart of the Andes'' and the Reverend Louis Legrand Noble's ''Church's Picture, The Heart of the Andes''. In the manner of travel guides, the booklets provided a tour of the painting's varied topography. An excerpt from Noble reads:

{{quote|Imagine yourself, late in the afternoon with the sun behind you, to be travelling up the valley along the bank of a river, at an elevation above the hot country of some five or six thousand feet. At the point to which you have ascended, heavily-wooded mountains close in on either hand, (not visible in the picture&amp;nbsp;– only the foot of each jutting into view,) richly clothed with trees and all the appendage of the forest, with the river flowing between them. ... Conspicuous on the opposite side of the river is the road leading into the country above, a wild bridle-path in the brightest sunshine, winding up into, and losing itself in the thick shady woods.  The foreground ... forms of itself a scene of unrivalled power and brilliancy, ...&lt;ref name=&quot;avery&quot;/&gt;}}

Church wanted Humboldt, his intellectual mentor, to see his masterpiece. Close to the end of the first exhibition, on May 9, 1859 he wrote of this desire to American poet [[Bayard Taylor]]:

{{quote|The &quot;Andes&quot; will probably be on its way to Europe before your return to the City ... [The] principal motive in taking the picture to Berlin is to have the satisfaction of placing before Humboldt a transcript of the scenery which delighted his eyes sixty years ago—and which he had pronounced to be the finest in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;gould&quot;&gt;Gould, Stephen Jay. &quot;Church, Humboldt, and Darwin: The Tension and Harmony of Art and Science.&quot; ''Latin American Popular Culture: An Introduction''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield: 2000. {{ISBN|0-8420-2711-4}}; pp. 27–42.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Humboldt, however, had died on May 6, so the planned shipment to Europe did not occur. However, later in 1859, the painting was exhibited in [[London]], where it met with similar popularity, and engravings allowed for broad distribution&lt;!--could do with more detail / yup! --&gt;. Showings in six more U.S. cities followed. The 1864 exhibition at the Metropolitan Sanitary Fair at New York's [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]] is better documented than the original exhibit; photographs confirm how the painting was displayed.

== Reception and legacy ==

The painting was widely acclaimed. Poetry was written in its honor, and a composer, George William Warren, dedicated a piece to it in 1863. [[Mark Twain]] described the painting to a friend:
{{quote|You will never get tired of looking at the picture, but your reflections—your efforts to grasp an intelligible Something—you hardly know what—will grow so painful that you will have to go away from the thing, in order to obtain relief. You may find relief, but you cannot banish the picture—it remains with you still. It is in my mind now—and the smallest feature could not be removed without my detecting it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;butt&quot;/&gt;}}

A ''New York Times'' art critic wrote of the painting's &quot;harmony of design&quot;: &quot;what seems, at first, a chaos of chords or colors gradually rises upon the enchanted mind a rich and orderly creation, full of familiar objects, yet wholly new in its combinations and its significance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Sachs, pp. 99–100&lt;/ref&gt;

Church eventually sold the work for $10,000—at that time the highest price ever paid for a work by a living American artist. The painting was acquired by Margaret Dows, widow of David Dows, and bequeathed to the Metropolitan Museum of Art upon her death in February 1909.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', February 3, 1909&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the museum held an exhibition that attempted to reproduce the conditions of the 1859 exhibit.

&lt;!--stub--&gt;Recent accounts of the painting have placed it within modern thematic discourses, such as the tension between art and science, and [[American imperialism|American territorial expansion]].  The split between the humanities and the scientific worldview was nascent in 1859: [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' would be published later in the same year as Church's painting.&lt;ref name=&quot;gould&quot;/&gt;

== In Literature ==
The painting and its 1859 exhibition is mentioned in the novel ''[[A Salty Piece of Land]]'' by [[Jimmy Buffett]].

'''''Weymouth Bay: Bowleaze Cove and Jordon Hill''''' was painted by the leading [[England|English]] landscape artist [[John Constable]] in 1816–17. The painting now hangs in the [[National Gallery, London]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/john-constable-weymouth-bay-bowleaze-cove-and-jordon-hill Weymouth Bay: Bowleaze Cove and Jordon Hill], [[The National Gallery]], London, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1816, Constable spent his honeymoon at the village of [[Osmington]] near the seaside town of [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]] in [[Dorset]]. The idea for this painting dates from this period. The painting shows a view of [[Weymouth Bay]] on the south coast of [[England]], looking west. The painting includes [[Bowleaze Cove]], [[Jordan Hill, Dorset|Jordan Hill]]. and the small Jordan River flowing over the beach, with [[Furzy Cliff]] behind. Beyond that in the far distance is the beach at [[Greenhill, Dorset|Greenhill]].

A larger version of the painting called ''Osmington Shore'' was exhibited by Constable at the [[British Institution]] in 1819.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The '''''Great Piece of Turf'''''&lt;ref&gt;The work is sometimes referred to as the ''Large Piece of Turf'', or ''The Large Turf''.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-de|'''Das große Rasenstück'''}}) is a [[watercolor painting]] by [[Albrecht Dürer]]. The painting was created at Dürer's workshop in [[Nuremberg]] in 1503. It is a study of a seemingly unordered group of wild plants, including [[Taraxacum|dandelion]] and [[Plantago major|greater plantain]]. The work is considered one of the masterpieces of Dürer's [[Realism (arts)|realistic]] nature studies.

==Background==
In 1495  Dürer  returned from his ''Wanderjahre ''in Italy and settled in [[Nuremberg]], where he opened a workshop.&lt;ref name=&quot;H57&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Hutchinson|first=Jane Campbell|title=Albrecht Dürer: A Biography|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|year=1990|isbn=0-691-00297-5|pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dürer was only twenty-four years old at the time, but his workshop soon gained a great reputation for the high quality of his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;H57&quot;/&gt; In 1500 he produced what is perhaps his most famous work, his Christ-like ''[[Self-Portrait (Dürer, Munich)|Self-Portrait]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time he was also creating smaller-scale works that were more focused on the study of nature, such as the ''Great Piece of Turf'', which he painted in 1503, and the ''[[Young Hare]]'' from the year before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gombrich|first=E.H.|title=The Story of Art|location=London &amp; New York|year=1995|edition=16th|isbn=0-7148-3355-X|pages=345|publisher=Phaidon Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The watercolour shows a large piece of turf and little else. The various plants can be identified as [[Dactylis|cock's-foot]], [[Agrostis|creeping bent]], [[Smooth Meadow-grass|smooth meadow-grass]], [[Bellis perennis|daisy]], [[Taraxacum|dandelion]], [[Veronica chamaedrys|germander speedwell]], [[Plantago major|greater plantain]], [[Cynoglossum|hound's-tongue]] and [[Achillea millefolium|yarrow]].&lt;ref name=&quot;L&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/great-works/drer-albrecht-the-large-turf-1503-770976.html|title=Dürer, Albrecht: The Large Turf (1503)|last=Lubbock|first=Tom|date=2008-01-18|publisher=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=2008-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting shows a great level of realism in its portrayal of natural objects.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the roots have been stripped of earth to be displayed clearly to the spectator. The depiction of roots is something that can also be found in other of Dürer's works, such as ''[[Knight, Death, and the Devil]]'' (1513).&lt;ref name=&quot;K170&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuspit|first=Donald B.|date=Winter 1972–1973|title=Dürer's Scientific Side|journal=Art Journal|volume=32|issue=2|pages=163–171|jstor=775728|doi=10.2307/775728}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vegetation comes to an end on the right side of the panel, while on the left it seems to continue on indefinitely. The background is left blank, and on the right can even be seen a clear line where the vegetation ends.&lt;ref name=&quot;L&quot;/&gt;

==Scholarly assessment==
The [[Humanism|humanist]] scholar [[Conrad Celtes]] compared Dürer's work to the literary work of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] philosopher and scientist [[Albertus Magnus]]. Like Magnus, Dürer based his work on the observation of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson, pp. 67&amp;ndash;9.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the ''Wild Hare'', the ''Great Piece of Turf'' had been called one of the masterpieces of this part of Dürer's work.&lt;ref name=&quot;H69&quot;&gt;Hutchinson, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The composition shows little order and arrangement, the various roots, stems and flowers seem to be in opposition to each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;K170&quot;/&gt; The apparent chaos, combined with the attentive detail of each individual plant, lends the painting greater realism.&lt;ref name=&quot;L&quot;/&gt; Though the composition of vegetation in itself is continuous and seemingly disorganised, the blank background provides a contrast to the chaos, and imposes a sense of order.&lt;ref name=&quot;L&quot;/&gt;

Though this work has been highly valued by later art historians, a realistic representation of nature was not a goal in itself for Dürer, but simply a tool for better conveying the sacred messages of his greater works.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, pp. 346&amp;ndash;7.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Great Piece of Turf'' was primarily a study that would help him in the development of his art. The results can be seen both in his paintings, and in his highly detailed [[engraving]]s, such as ''[[:File:Adam Eva, Durer, 1504.jpg|Adam and Eve]]'' from 1504.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, pp. 346&amp;ndash;9.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Salisbury Cathedral from the Bishop's Grounds''''' is an 1823 painting by the nineteenth-century landscape painter [[John Constable]] (1776–1837). This image of [[Salisbury Cathedral]], one of England's most famous medieval churches, is one of his most celebrated works, and was commissioned by one of his closest friends, [[John Fisher (Anglican bishop)|John Fisher]], The Bishop of Salisbury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O56227/salisbury-cathedral-from-the-bishops-oil-painting-john-constable/ V&amp;A page]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Constable visited Salisbury in 1820 and made a series of oil sketches of the cathedral, which served as the model for this composition. The artist selected a viewpoint from the bishop's garden and included figures of Dr. Fisher and his wife at the bottom left. Following its exhibition at the 1823 Royal Academy, Constable observed: &quot;My Cathedral looks very well....It was the most difficult subject in Landscape I ever had upon my Easel. I have not flinched at the work of the windows, buttresses, &amp;c. – but I have as usual made my escape in the Evanescence of the [[chiaroscuro|Chiaro-Oscuro]]&quot;. His patron took exception to the dark cloud over the cathedral, and when he commissioned a smaller replica, requested &quot;a more serene sky&quot;. 

The painting embodies the full range of qualities of a quintessentially British [[landscape painting]] – the clouds, trees, a water meadow, cattle drinking at the edge of the pasture and the glorious architecture of a medieval cathedral – but all on a human scale.{{cn|date=March 2015}} Paintings like this one have so conditioned our view of rural Britain that it is now difficult to imagine a time when the countryside and country life were not held in such high regard.{{cn|date=March 2015}}

A version of the painting also resides at the [[Frick Collection]] in New York City.  It is slightly different in that it shows different weather and hence light.  Whereas the London version depicts the cathedral with an overcast sky, the version in the Frick shows the cathedral with a clear, bright sky.

A small version of the painting resides at the [[Huntington Library]] in [[San Marino, California]]. John Fisher gave it to his daughter as a wedding present.

There is an earlier, homonymous version (1821-1822) of this painting at [[São Paulo Museum of Art]] in São Paulo.&lt;ref&gt;http://masp.art.br/masp2010/acervo_detalheobra.php?id=662&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that Fisher, seeing its sombre and grave colors, disliked it and asked for a happier, lighter one.

In painting, a '''capriccio''' ({{IPA-it|kaˈprittʃo}}, &lt;small&gt;plural:&lt;/small&gt; ''capricci'' {{IPA-it|kaˈprittʃi|}};  in older English works often anglicized as &quot;caprice&quot;) means an architectural fantasy, placing together buildings, archaeological ruins and other architectural elements in fictional and often fantastical combinations, and may include [[staffage]] (figures). It falls under the more general term of [[landscape painting]]. The term is also used for other artworks with an element of fantasy.

==History==
The predecessor of this type of decorative architectural paintings can be found in 16th-century Italian painting, and in particular in the architectural settings that were painted as the framework of large-scale frescoes and ceiling decorations known as [[Illusionistic ceiling painting|'quadratture']]. These architectural elements gained prominence in 17th-century painting to become stand-alone subjects of easel paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/lot/alessandro-salucci-and-jan-miel-an-4794182-details.aspx?pos=1&amp;intObjectID=4794182&amp;sid=&amp;page=5&amp;lid=1 Alessandro Salucci (Florence 1590–1655/60 Rome) and Jan Miel (Beveren-Waes 1599–1664 Turin), ''An architectural capriccio with an ionic portico, a fountain, a two story loggia, a Gothic palace and figures on a quay''] at Christie's&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Alessandro Salucci (Attr.) - Capriccio.jpg|thumb|left|Capriccio, by [[Alessandro Salucci]]]]

Early practitioners of the genre who made the genre popular in mid-17th century Rome included [[Alessandro Salucci]] and [[Viviano Codazzi]]. The artists represent two different approaches to the genre: Codazzi's capricci were more realistic than those of Salucci who showed more creativity and liberty in his approach by rearranging Roman monuments to fit his compositional objectives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antiquares.it/acquista-online/importante-architettura-di-alessandro-salucci-firenze-1590-roma-dopo-il-1650/ Importante architettura di Alessandro Salucci (Firenze 1590-Roma dopo il 1650)] at Antiquares {{link language|it|Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 'quadratture' frescoes of [[Agostino Tassi]] and the urban views of [[Claude Lorrain]] and [[Herman van Swanevelt]], which he saw in Rome, may have stimulated Viviano Codazzi to start painting capricci.&lt;ref&gt;Ludovica Trezzani. &quot;Codazzi, Viviano.&quot; Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 24 Apr. 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

This genre was perfected {{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} by [[Marco Ricci]] (1676–1730) but its best-known proponent was the artist [[Giovanni Paolo Pannini]] (1691–1765). This style was extended in the 1740s by [[Canaletto]] in his etched ''[[vedute]] ideali'', and works by [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi|Piranesi]] and his imitators.

Later examples include [[Charles Robert Cockerell]]'s ''A Tribute to Sir Christopher Wren'' and ''A Professor's Dream'', and [[Joseph Gandy]]'s ''1818 Public and Private Buildings Executed by Sir John Soane''. The artist Carl Laubin has painted a number of modern capriccios in homage to these works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0PAL/is_/ai_n26798437 A classical fantasia: Carl Laubin has resurrected all C.R. Cockerell's major works in one ambitious, extraordinary painting], David Watkin, ''Apollo'',  March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Marco Ricci - A Classical Landscape with Ruins.jpg|thumb|Classical landscape with ruins, c. 1725, by [[Marco Ricci]]]]

The term can be used more broadly for other works with a strong element of fantasy. The ''Capricci'', an influential series of [[etching]]s by [[Gianbattista Tiepolo]] (1730s?, published in 1743), reduced the architectural elements to chunks of classical statuary and ruins, among which small groups made up of a cast of exotic and elegant figures of soldiers, philosophers and beautiful young people go about their enigmatic business. No individual titles help to explain these works; mood and style are everything. A later series was called ''Scherzi di fantasia''&amp;nbsp;– &quot;Fantastic Sketches&quot;. His son [[Domenico Tiepolo]] was among those who imitated these prints, often using the term in titles.

[[Goya]]'s series of eighty [[old master print|prints]] ''[[Los Caprichos]]'', and the last group of prints in his series ''[[The Disasters of War]]'', which he called &quot;caprichos enfáticos&quot; (&quot;emphatic caprices&quot;), are far from the spirit of light-hearted fantasy the term usually suggests. They take Tiepolo's format of a group of figures, now drawn from contemporary Spanish life, and are a series of savage satires and comments on its absurdity, only partly explicated by short titles.

'''''Effect of Snow on Petit-Montrouge''''' (French: '''''Effet de neige à Petit-Montrouge''''') is an 1870 [[landscape painting]] by the French painter [[Édouard Manet]]. 

==History==

The oil on canvas painting shows a winter view of [[Petit-Montrouge]], an area in the [[14th arrondissement of Paris]]. Manet painted this picture while a member of the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]] during the 1870–71 [[Siege of Paris (1870-1871)|Siege of Paris]] of the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. As opposed to the [[History painting|history painters]] of his time, Manet does not show a heroic view of battle, but rather the dusky ambiance of a looming battle. The image reflects Manet's loss of hope about the military situation, his profound loneliness, and the deprivation he suffered during this time. It is one of the few landscapes in Manet's oeuvre, and is one of Manet's first ''[[plein air]]'' paintings. Today it is in the collection of the [[National Museum Cardiff]]. 

==Composition==

Manet uses earthly and muted tones to illustrate an urban snow landscape; between the large peaks of white and diagonals of murky brown the Paris district of Petit-Montrouge is illustrate, overshadowed by the brown dirty snow and bleak beige sky. The buildings in the background were painted with muted colours to give an appearance of balancing precariously on a huge expanse of brown.

'''''The West Wind''''' is a painting by Canadian artist [[Tom Thomson]]. An iconic image, the pine at its centre has been described as growing &quot;in the national ethos as our one and only tree in a country of trees&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;S1&quot;&gt;Silcox and Town, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; It was the artist's final painting, and according to some art historians was unfinished at the time of his sudden death by drowning in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, Donald W. &quot;Canadian Painters, from Paul Kane to the Group of Seven&quot;. London: Phaidon Press, 1945. p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomson based ''The West Wind'' on an earlier, slightly different sketch he produced in 1916 while working as a park ranger in [[Algonquin Provincial Park|Algonquin Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Marcel Granger – Tom Thomson's The West Wind | url =http://www.lino.com/~marcelg/vent_an.htm|accessdate = 2007-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the finished canvas Thomson moved the pine further to the right, replaced a less defined foreground plane with strongly patterned rock shapes, and removed a dead tree limb from the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;S1&quot;/&gt;  The location of the subject is uncertain; Thomson's friend Winifred Trainor believed the site represented was [[Cedar Lake (Nipissing District)|Cedar Lake]], though Grand Lake, Algonquin Park has also been proposed as the setting.&lt;ref name=&quot;M1&quot;&gt;Murray (1999), 78&lt;/ref&gt; Some locals believe the location to be on Kawawaymog Lake.&lt;ref name=&quot;X1&quot;&gt;Personal Conversation between Giulia Forsythe and a Local&lt;/ref&gt;

As in his iconic ''[[The Jack Pine]]'', Thomson began the painting with an undercoat of [[vermilion]] that he allowed to show through in various places to contrast with the greens, to lend the work a feeling of &quot;vibration&quot; and movement.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (1996), 115&lt;/ref&gt; The pine dominates the composition without obscuring the view into the distance, and is successful as both specific representation and abstract design.&lt;ref name=&quot;S1&quot;/&gt;

Though not imposing in scale, it is a graceful arabesque decoration, &quot;a magnified bonsai&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;S1&quot;/&gt; Thomson's background in design lent his composition an [[Art Nouveau|art-nouveau]] sensibility, for example, &quot;in the way a single tree stands silhouetted against water or the sky like a symbol of romantic solitude&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Page 41 in Belton, Robert James (2001). ''Sights of resistance: approaches to Canadian visual culture'', volume 1. University of Calgary Press. {{ISBN|1-55238-011-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; An earlier reviewer noticed the same effect in it and ''The Jack Pine'': &quot;[these] two best-known canvases... are essentially ''Art Nouveau'' designs in the flat, the principal motif in each case being a tree drawn in great sinuous curves... Such pictures, are, however, saved from complete stylization by the use of uncompromisingly native subject-matter and of Canadian colours, the glowing colours of autumn.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quotation of R.H. Hubbard (1962) in Reid, Dennis (p. 27). ''Tom Thomson: The Jack Pine''. Masterpieces in the National Gallery of Canada (No. 5). Ottawa: National Gallery of Canada, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Trainor, Thomson was not satisfied with the picture, fearing that the flat abstract shapes of the foreground rocks and trees were inconsistent with the atmospheric conception of the background.&lt;ref name=&quot;M2&quot;&gt;Murray (1999), 114&lt;/ref&gt; However, for Thomson's colleague [[Arthur Lismer]], the trees in ''The West Wind'' were symbolic of the national character, models of resolve against the elements.&lt;ref name=&quot;M2&quot;&gt;Murray (1999), 114&lt;/ref&gt;  Thomson biographer and curator Joan Murray, while initially disliking the painting, wrote that it &quot;is a powerful canvas; resonating with its message of weather and wind, it expressed the divine as some of us imagine it in Canada. This is the sort of tree that would stand at the gates of heaven to open the doors of the kingdom.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Murray (1996), 120&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Canadian Club of Toronto]] donated ''The West Wind'' to the recently opened Art Gallery of Toronto (now the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]]). Librarian [[George Locke]], a club member, announced the donation in a speech, praising Thomson's accomplishments: &quot;Thomson needs no tablet to commemorate his achievements ... He has left us work that expresses our national life – the forces of the great natural surroundings of this young land.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Cameron, Ross D. (1999). &quot;[http://www.erudit.org/revue/jcha/1999/v10/n1/030513ar.pdf Tom Thomson, Antimodernism, and the Ideal of Manhood].&quot; ''Journal of the Canadian Historical Association'' 10(1):185–208.&lt;/ref&gt; 

On the fiftieth anniversary of Thomson's death, the Canadian government honoured him with a series of stamps portraying his works, including ''The West Wind'' and ''The Jack Pine''. On 3 May 1990 Canada Post issued 'The West Wind, Tom Thomson, 1917' in the Masterpieces of Canadian art series. The stamp was designed by Pierre-Yves Pelletier based on an oil painting &quot;The West Wind&quot;, (1917) by Thomas John Thomson in the Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto, Ontario. The 50¢ stamps are perforated 13 X 13.5 and were printed by Ashton-Potter Limited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://data4.collectionscanada.gc.ca/netacgi/nph-brs?s1=(art.TITP.)+Or+(art.TITI.+And+null.B742.)&amp;l=20&amp;d=STMP&amp;p=1&amp;u=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/archivianet/02011702_e.html&amp;r=6&amp;f=G&amp;Sect1=STMP Canada Post stamp]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Jack Pine, by Tom Thomson.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Tom Thomson]], ''The Jack Pine'' (1916–17). Oil on canvas; 127.9 × 139.8 cm. [[National Gallery of Canada]], Ottawa]]

'''''The Jack Pine''''' is a well-known [[oil painting]] by [[Canadian art]]ist [[Tom Thomson]]. A representation of the most broadly distributed [[pine]] species in Canada,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsu.edu/project/dendrology/index/plantae/vascular/seedplants/gymnosperms/conifers/pine/pinus/contortae/jack/jackpine.html ncsu]&lt;/ref&gt; it is considered an iconic image of the country's landscape,&lt;ref name=&quot;S1&quot;&gt;Silcox, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NGC&quot;&gt;[http://cybermuse.gallery.ca/cybermuse/search/artwork_e.jsp?mkey=11056 National Gallery of Canada]&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the country's most widely recognized and reproduced artworks.

The painting was completed in 1917, the year of Thomson's death. It is a roughly square canvas that measures 127.9&amp;nbsp;× 139.8 cm. It has been in the collection of the [[National Gallery of Canada]] in [[Ottawa]] since 1918. 

==Background==
[[File:Tom Thomson - Pine Island, Georgian Bay.jpg|thumb|Foreground trees and a distant body of water form a common motif in Thomson's work. In this regard ''Pine Island, Georgian Bay'' (1914–16) is a precursor to ''The Jack Pine'' and ''[[The West Wind (painting)|The West Wind]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Tom Thomson (2002), 40&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
Beginning in 1913, Thomson annually stayed in [[Algonquin Park]] from the spring until the autumn, often working as a guide while also fishing and painting for his own pleasure. In 1916, he also worked in the Park as a fire ranger.&lt;ref&gt;Klages, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; It was there, on Grand Lake with the hills near Carcajou Bay in the background, that Thomson made the oil [[study (art)|sketch]] in 1916 that he would use for the final painting in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;M1&quot;&gt;Murray, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous other paintings by Thomson with compositions similar to that of ''The Jack Pine'': in fact, the majority of Thomson's canvasses depict the far side of a shore.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;  These include ''Northern Lake'' (1912–13), his first; ''Pine Island, Georgian Bay'' (1914–16; pictured); and more famously, ''[[The West Wind (painting)|The West Wind]]'' (1917), another painting of iconic status.&lt;ref name=&quot;S1&quot;&gt;Silcox, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Tom Thomson Sketch for 'The Jack Pine' 1916.jpg|thumb|Thomson's spring 1916 sketch for ''The Jack Pine''. Oil on panel; 21.1 x 26.8 cm. [[RiverBrink Art Museum]], Queenston, Canada (purchased 1947).&lt;ref&gt;''Tom Thomson'' (2002), plate 97&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The painting depicts a [[jack pine]] as a decorative and abstracted pattern, its shapes boldly simplified against the sunset.&lt;ref name=&quot;NGC&quot;&gt;[http://cybermuse.gallery.ca/cybermuse/search/artwork_e.jsp?mkey=11056 National Gallery of Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;M1&quot;/&gt; This stylization demonstrates Thomson's command of decorative effects, developed during his years as a graphic designer,&lt;ref&gt;Marlow, Kirk. &quot;[http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/opr/t118/e2580 Thomson, Tom].&quot; The Oxford Companion to Western Art. Ed. Hugh Brigstocke. Oxford Art Online. June 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and with the strong colour and value contrasts, creates the picture's symbolic resonance.&lt;ref name=&quot;NGC&quot;&gt;[http://cybermuse.gallery.ca/cybermuse/search/artwork_e.jsp?mkey=11056 National Gallery of Canada]&lt;/ref&gt; The pine, its branches bowed and placed to the right of centre, extends nearly the full length of the canvas, and is cropped at the top. It rises from a rocky foreground; the hardy jack pine often takes root on shores hostile to other trees, its sparsely leaved branches forming eccentric shapes.&lt;ref name=&quot;M1&quot;/&gt; It is silhouetted against water and sky, with the canvas bisected by the far shore.

The final canvas differs markedly from Thomson's spring 1916 sketch.&lt;ref&gt;''Tom Thomson'' (2002), pp. 140–141&lt;/ref&gt; He made the tree appear larger by lowering the hills on the far side of the lake. The weather had been stormy when Thomson made the sketch and the dark, rolling clouds were echoed in the heavy, swirling brushwork of the sky and the slate grey lake. In the final painting, Thomson has swapped the storm clouds for a clear twilight sky. The sky and lake are now highly stylized, painted in long horizontal brushstrokes that show, along with its nearly square format, the influence of Thomson's colleague [[Lawren Harris]].&lt;ref name=&quot;M1&quot;/&gt;

Thomson began with a [[vermilion]] red undertone, which he likely chose to avoid mixing the [[complementary colour]]s red and green. The red was allowed to show through in parts of the tree, foreground landscape, and hills,&lt;ref name=&quot;M1&quot;/&gt; making the colour &quot;[seem] to vibrate&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;p. 79 in Murray, Joan (1998). ''Tom Thomson: Design For a Canadian Hero''. Dundurn Press. {{ISBN|1550023152}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Yet the focal point of the painting is not in the foreground, but at the distant shore—the patch of snow just below the centre of the canvas. Dennis Reid, who wrote a booklet on the painting for the National Gallery, points out an almost circular shape made by the foreground elements that encompass the focal point. The circle is formed from the large curving branches of the tree, the sloping left foreground, and the smaller tree at right. Reid writes&lt;!--haha--&gt; that this near-circle &quot;exists in space more like a ball, and as we peer through that ball to the opposite shore, for an instant we're inside our eye.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Reid, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomson's background in design lent his composition an [[Art Nouveau|Art-Nouveau]] sensibility. One reviewer notes the effect in it and ''The West Wind'': &quot;[these] two best-known canvases&amp;nbsp;... are essentially ''Art Nouveau'' designs in the flat, the principal motif in each case being a tree drawn in great sinuous curves&amp;nbsp;... Such pictures, are, however, saved from complete stylization by the use of uncompromisingly native subject-matter and of Canadian colours, the glowing colours of autumn.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quotation of R. H. Hubbard (1962), in Reid, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[A. Y. Jackson]], Thomson was dissatisfied with the canvas, particularly the background and sky.&lt;ref name=&quot;M1&quot;/&gt;

== Interpretation ==

Tom Thomson had little to say about ''The Jack Pine'' or his painting in general. ''The Jack Pine'', a stylized landscape with few elements&amp;nbsp;– painted by a man who died the year he painted it, a man who would become an icon in his country&amp;nbsp;— has encouraged various readings of Thomson's artistic motivations. Dennis Reid observes the limitations of received views of such popular artworks: &quot;''The Jack Pine'', is, after all, like all successful works of art a living thing that grows or declines, unfolds or closes up, according to the nature and the quality of the attention it receives. In that sense, there are as many meanings as there are viewers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Reid, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

Blodwen Davies was the first biographer of Thomson, and a [[Theosophist]]. Emphasizing the &quot;spirit&quot; of the painting, she wrote in 1935, &quot;the spirit of the canvas leaps out to meet the spectator in a way no reproduction can fully convey. There is no fumbling, no hesitancy here&amp;nbsp;... [Thomson's] brush was sure. Heavily laden with paint it swept over the canvas in broad, exultant strokes in which the very spirit of Tom Thomson still speaks aloud.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Reid, pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt; Another Theosophist, Fred Housser, described the painting in 1926 as &quot;a devotional meditative study. A single tree stands spreading the tracery of its limbs and branches like the pulsating veins of Mother Nature&amp;nbsp;... [One] could believe that this tree was to the nature-worshipper Thomson what the symbol of the cross was to a mediaeval mystic.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;r26&quot;&gt;Quoted in Reid, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomson was an important influence on the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]], with members such as [[Lawren Harris]] advocating his work. In a review of the Art Gallery of Toronto's Inaugural Exhibition of 1926, Harris dismissed much of the American art shown there, writing that most of it &quot;represented the average of the academies... no one of these canvasses&lt;ref&gt;Harris reserved praise only for [[Arthur B. Davies]] and [[Rockwell Kent]] with respect to American art at the exhibition. (Larisey)&lt;/ref&gt; approaches Thomson's ''The West Wind'' or ''Jack Pine'' in devotion and greatness of spirit.&quot; Those two paintings, he wrote, &quot;contain the lasting qualities of the best old masters. The devotional mood of ''The Jack Pine'' is the same as in [[Giovanni Bellini]]'s ''Madonna and Child''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Larisey, Peter. ''Light for a Cold Land: Lawren Harris's Work and Life – An Interpretation''. Toronto: Dundern Press, 1993. {{ISBN|1-55002-188-5}}. p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Arthur Lismer]], also part of the Group of Seven, commented on Thomson's painting. Writing in 1930, he stated that ''The Jack Pine'' was a work of &quot;significant form&amp;nbsp;... The artist thinks of big things first&amp;nbsp;– and the design in this picture is the biggest thing in it. It is like a symphony of music. All the instruments are playing a part, and none is out of harmony with the whole&amp;nbsp;... the theme of a painting is a movement in space. The upright lines of the tree trunk give it serenity; the horizontal lines of the shore supplement this and give it strength; the rounded masses of the hills repeat the circular rhythm of the foliage masses, giving movement and powerful rhythm to the whole composition.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;r26&quot;/&gt;

Peter Mellen, author of ''The Group of Seven'' (1970), wrote of the work's &quot;perfect serenity. It is evening&amp;nbsp;– the sky and lake are perfectly calm and are painted in broad, flat horizontal strokes. Even the soft mauves, pinks, and greens contribute to this effect. Countering the strong horizontals are the drooping red tendrils of the bare pine branches, the vertical lines of the trees, and the curves of the hills&amp;nbsp;... [Thomson] achieves pure poetry in painting, by combining an intuitive feeling for nature with an almost classical control of technique.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Reid, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, Jean Boggs proposed that Thomson was influenced by the European [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]]: &quot;against the dying light and sky the scraggly forms of ''The Jack Pine'' are most dramatic, its branches struggling to life but dominated by dark-green, tattered, bat-like forms as if the tree were a symbol&amp;nbsp;– beautiful, oriental, but a symbol nevertheless of Thomson's wish for his own death on this spot.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Reid, 28&lt;/ref&gt; Others considered the painting evidence that Thomson was, or might have become, an increasingly [[abstract art|abstract]] or [[expressionism|Expressionist]] artist.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, p. 29; Grace&lt;/ref&gt;

== Provenance and exhibition ==

The [[National Gallery of Canada]] in [[Ottawa]] has held the work since shortly after its creation. During his wilderness travels, Thomson likely stored ''The Jack Pine'' in his shack behind the [[Studio Building (Toronto)|Studio Building]]. In late 1917, Dr. Norm MacCallum, Thomson's patron, put it and a few other works by Thomson on display at the [[The Arts and Letters Club of Toronto|Arts and Letters Club]]. Representatives of the National Gallery visited the club on two occasions in the spring of 1918. The museum wished to add to its existing collection of three works by Thomson. Director Eric Brown was appalled on his first visit at the poor lighting provided the paintings. For the second visit, May 2, the display had been improved, and the director and his associate chose ''The Jack Pine'' (along with Thomson's ''Autumn Garland'' and 25 sketches) for the National Gallery. Brown wrote to a colleague that ''The Jack Pine'' was &quot;in our opinion, and that of Thomson's fellow painters, the best picture of any kind he ever painted.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Reid, pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt;

Two months after ''The Jack Pine'' arrived in Ottawa in August 1918, it was sent to St. Louis, Missouri, as part of an exhibition of contemporary [[Canadian art]]. It circulated until 1919, and only in February 1920 was the painting first displayed in Canada, as part of a Thomson memorial exhibition. In the next five decades it would be displayed widely, in Europe (London, Paris, Ghent), and across Canada and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Jack Pine'' was included in an exhibition of Thomson's work that travelled across Canada in 2003, organized by the National Gallery and the Art Gallery of Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;A 140-plate book on Thomson was published in 2002 to coincide with the exhibition.&lt;/ref&gt; It was then shown at the [[Hermitage Museum]] in Russia in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2004/09/09/thomsonhermitage040909.html Iconic Tom Thomson works showcased at Russia's Hermitage].

== Legacy ==
[[Image:Tom Thomson Jack Pine Achray Algonquin Park Ontario Canada.jpg|thumb|150px|The site of Thomson's sketch for the painting, photographed in 2007]]

''The Jack Pine'', with other works by Thomson, has become an iconic representation of the [[Canadian geography|Canadian landscape]]. Thomson's life and mysterious death is a popular subject of Canadian biography and poetry. Even ''The Jack Pine'' is a title referent in a few poems, including [[Henry Beissel]]'s &quot;Tom Thomson's Jackpine&quot; and Doug Barbour's &quot;Tom Thomson's 'The Jack Pine' (1916–1917)&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Grace, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Beissel's poem concludes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
... the light is at peace with the tree and the lake.
Calmly it amplifies the beryline silence brooding
on the waters where Tom's spirit rests forever
alongside the sky stretched out in the shadow
of the jackpine that holds heaven and earth
together in an embrace encompassing the hills
the lake, the seasons, and the void that fills
the dark spaces between them and infinity.&lt;ref&gt;Reprinted in full in [https://books.google.com/books?id=D9CfKx7SeIoC&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=%22the%20light%20is%20at%20peace%20with%20the%20tree%22&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20light%20is%20at%20peace%20with%20the%20tree%22&amp;f=false Grace, p. 2]. Attributed to unpublished typescript, no date&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The painting has been widely reproduced, seen across Canada in schools and public institutions. In 1967, a stamp featuring ''The Jack Pine'' was released to coincide with the fiftieth anniversary of the painting's creation and Thomson's death.&lt;ref&gt;Grace, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The pine depicted in the painting was located by park staff in 1970.

'''''A Wheatfield with Cypresses''''' (occasionally called ''A Cornfield with Cypresses'') is any of three similar 1889 oil paintings by [[Vincent van Gogh]], as part of his [[Wheat Fields (Van Gogh series)|wheat field]] series.  All were executed at the [[Saint-Paul-de-Mausole]] mental asylum at [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence|Saint-Rémy]] near [[Arles]], France, where Van Gogh was voluntarily a patient from May 1889 to May 1890.  The works were inspired by the view from the window at the asylum towards the [[Alpilles]] mountains.

The painting depicts golden fields of ripe wheat, a dark fastigiate [[Provence|Provençal]] [[Cupressus sempervirens|cypress]] towering like a green obelisk to the right and lighter green [[olive tree]]s in the middle distance, with hills and mountains visible behind, and white clouds swirling in an azure sky above.  The first version (F717)  was painted in late June or early July 1889, during a period of frantic painting and shortly after Van Gogh completed ''[[The Starry Night]]'', at a time when he was fascinated by the cypress.  It is likely to have been painted &quot;[[en plein air]]&quot;, near the subject, when Van Gogh was able to leave the precincts of the asylum.  Van Gogh regarded this work as one of his best summer paintings.  In a letter to his brother, [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]], written on 2 July 1889, Vincent described the painting: &quot;I have a canvas of cypresses with some ears of wheat, some poppies, a blue sky like a piece of [[tartan|Scotch plaid]]; the former painted with a thick impasto like the [[Adolphe Monticelli|Monticelli]]'s, and the wheat field in the sun, which represents the extreme heat, very thick too.&quot;

Van Gogh suffered a bout of severe mental illness in late July and early August, but was able to resume painting in late August and early September 1889.  After making a [[Reed pen|reed-pen]] drawing of the work, now held by the [[Van Gogh Museum]] in Amsterdam, he copied the composition twice in oils in his studio, one approximately the same size (F615) and a smaller version (F743).  The larger studio version was probably painted in a single sitting, with a few minor later adjustments adding touches of yellow and brown.  Van Gogh sketched out the design with [[charcoal]] [[underdrawing]]; he applied thin paint on the cypress trees and sky, with the ground allowed to show in places, and thick [[impasto]] for the foreground wheat and the clouds above.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Van Gogh's A Cornfield, with Cypresses, John Leighton, Anthony Reeve, Ashok Roy and Raymond White, National Gallery Technical Bulletin, 1987, Volume 11, pp 42–59.&lt;/ref&gt;  Characteristically, he preferred the brilliant white of [[zinc white]] (zinc oxide) for the white clouds rather than [[lead white]], despite its poor drying qualities, with his [[Palette (painting)|palette]] also including [[cobalt blue]] for the sky, shades of [[chrome yellow]] for the wheat field, [[viridian]] and [[emerald green]] for the bushes and cypresses, and touches of [[vermilion]] for the poppies in the foreground and also synthetic [[ultramarine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://colourlex.com/project/van-gogh-wheatfield-cypresses/ Vincent van Gogh, A Wheatfield with Cypresses], illustrated pigment analysis at ColourLex&lt;/ref&gt;  The July &quot;plein air&quot; version was much more heavily worked, and may be considered a study for the more considered September studio painting.  He sent the smaller and less accomplished studio version to his mother and sister as a gift.

Vincent sent the larger July and September versions to his brother in Paris later in September 1889.  The July version was sold by Theo's widow in 1900 to artist [[Émile Schuffenecker]].  It passed through the hands of collector [[Alexandre Louis Philippe Marie Berthier, 4th Prince of Wagram|Alexandre Berthier]] and art dealer [[Paul Cassirer]] in Paris, where it was first exhibited and photographed at Galerie [[Eugène Druet]] in November 1909.  It was sold to banker [[Franz von Mendelssohn]] (1865–1935) in Berlin in 1910 and remained with the Mendelssohn family in Germany and Switzerland until it was sold to industrialist [[Emil Bührle]] in Zurich in 1952.  His son, [[Dieter Bührle]], sold the painting in 1993 to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York for $57 million using funds donated by publisher, diplomat and philanthropist [[Walter Annenberg]].

The [[National Gallery]] in London holds a similar version painted in Van Gogh's studio in September 1889, bought with the [[Courtauld Fund]] in 1923.  It is unlined, and was never varnished or waxed.  The third smaller version is held by a private collection (sold at [[Sotheby's]] in London in 1970; in the US in 1987).

'''''The Titan's Goblet''''' is an oil painting by the English-born American landscape artist [[Thomas Cole]]. Painted in 1833, it is perhaps the most enigmatic of Cole's [[allegorical]] or imaginary landscape scenes. It is a work that &quot;defies full explanation&quot;, according to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/all/the_titan_s_goblet_thomas_cole/objectview.aspx?page=1&amp;sort=0&amp;sortdir=asc&amp;keyword=titan%27s%20goblet&amp;fp=1&amp;dd1=0&amp;dd2=0&amp;vw=1&amp;collID=0&amp;OID=20010846&amp;vT=1&amp;hi=0&amp;ov=0 The Titan's Goblet. Collections Database, Metropolitan Museum of Art.] Accessed August 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Titan's Goblet'' has been called a &quot;picture within a picture&quot; and a &quot;landscape within a landscape&quot;: the goblet stands on conventional terrain, but its inhabitants live along its rim in a world all their own. Vegetation covers the entire brim, broken only by two tiny buildings, a Greek temple and an Italian palace. The vast waters are dotted with sailing vessels. Where the water spills upon the ground below, grass and a more rudimentary civilization spring up.

== Interpretations ==

Cole often provided text to accompany his paintings, but did not comment on ''The Titan's Goblet'', leaving his intentions open to debate. In the 1880s, one interpretation related Coles goblet to the [[world tree]] and specifically to the [[Yggdrasil]] in [[Norse mythology]]. A 1904 auction catalog continued this theme, writing &quot;the spiritual idea in the centre of the painting, conveying the beautiful Norse theory that life and the world is but a tree with ramifying branches, is carefully carried out by the painter&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parry126&quot;&gt;Parry, 126&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not obvious, however, that Cole would have been familiar with this concept, and critic Elwood C. Parry suggests that the likeness to any mythological tree is limited to the similarity of the goblet's stem to a tree trunk.  There is nothing about the goblet analogous to branches or roots.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parry126&quot;/&gt;

The scale of the massive stone goblet contrasts with that of the traditional landscape scene around it, inviting comparisons with the large stone objects left by ancient races of giants in [[Greek mythology]]—a view endorsed by art historian [[Erwin Panofsky]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Attributed to Panofsky in fn. 3, Parry, 123&lt;/ref&gt; The painting's title (given by Cole on the back of the canvas) seems to support this idea, as if much time had passed between the creation of this goblet and the current scene. The setting sun, a romantic symbol, also evokes the passage of time.

The dominance of the goblet in the painting might suggest a cosmological interpretation. Parry considers but rejects a comparison with the exterior panels of [[Hieronymus Bosch]]'s ''[[Garden of Earthly Delights]]'' (c. 1500), which are generally taken to depict the creation of Earth. Both images are of a contained world, but use water and terrain in differing proportions. Cole's ''Goblet'' offers neither iconography nor an inscription that would confirm a religious interpretation of the picture. Furthermore, the painter has placed the goblet far from the center of the canvas, which minimizes its emblematic significance.

The waters of the goblet, though, can be seen as a civilizing influence. The inhabitants of the goblet have a Utopian existence, pleasure boating on the tranquil waters and living among the temples and leafy woods. Where the waters spill onto the landscape below—where the two worlds interact—signs of life appear. In the background, far from the influence of the goblet's waters, the mountains are desolate and rocky. A similar depiction of civilization by the waterside can be seen in Cole's ''An Evening in Arcady'' (1843).

Louis Legrand Noble was a friend and biographer of Cole, and could have been expected to have some insight into the work. In his commentary, however, there is no mention of these ideas. He wrote, &quot;There [the goblet] stands, rather reposes upon its shaft, a tower-like mossy structure, light as a bubble, and yet a section of a substantial globe. As the eye circles its wide rolling brim, a circumference of many miles, it finds itself in fairy land; in accordance though with nature on her broadest scale... Tourists might travel in the countries of this imperial ring, and trace their fancies on many a romantic page. Here steeped in the golden splendors of a summer sunset, is a little sea from Greece, or Holy Land, with Greek and Syrian life, Greek and Syrian nature looking out upon its quiet waters.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted with ellipsis in Parry, 126&lt;/ref&gt;

Parry's 1971 article on the painting instead looks to Cole's first tour to Europe (1829–32) to unravel the imagery of the goblet. Cole visited England and its preeminent landscape painter, [[J.M.W. Turner]], whose work he had mixed feelings about. He was however drawn to Turner's ''[[:commons:File:Joseph Mallord William Turner 064.jpg|Ulysses Deriding Polyphemus]]'' (1829), making two sketches of the painting and another study for a possible treatment of his own, which did not come to fruition. The titular [[cyclops]] [[Polyphemus]] is pivotal to the ancient Greek epic ''[[The Odyssey]]'', and Cole's interest in the subject demonstrates his openness to &quot;the creative possibilities of such a Mediterranean scene&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Parry, 131&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, as Cole researched themes for his painting series ''[[The Course of Empire (paintings)|The Course of Empire]]'', he would have encountered the story of [[Mount Athos]] in [[Vitruvius]]'s ''Ten Books on Architecture''. The Ancient Roman writer recounts the suggestion of the architect [[Dinocrates]] to Alexander that the mountain be shaped into &quot;the statue of a man holding a spacious city in his left hand, and in his right a huge cup, into which shall be collected all the streams of the mountain, which shall thence be poured into the sea.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from Joseph Gwilt, translator, in Parry, 131&lt;/ref&gt; This fantastical image appeared in 18th- and 19th-century illustrations that Cole may have seen. As Parry writes, &quot;the precedent of a classical architectural fantasy on this scale supplies an alternative to the natural assumption that the Titan's goblet was actually made by a giant who simply left it behind&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Parry, 133&lt;/ref&gt; But a literal rendition of this image may not have suited Cole's art: being a landscape artist, he would have been more comfortable expressing it only topographically, avoiding the need to render a massive stone human form.

[[File:Thomas Cole sketch - Fantastic Fountain and Basins.jpg|thumb|200px|A fantastical sketch of a fountain and basins by Cole, c. 1832–33]]

Cole's drawings&lt;ref&gt;Found in his sketchbooks at the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]]&lt;/ref&gt; from his trip to Europe or shortly thereafter also appear to prefigure the ''Goblet''. They show his interest in fountains and basins and are influenced by those he saw during the Italian leg of his voyage, in Florence, Rome, and Tivoli. In one drawing, a series of huge basins adorned with vegetation descends to the sea. Another depicts a single, mossy-rimmed basin of normal size, but the ground-level view makes it appear monumental. Cole's drawings of the Italian [[volcanic lake]]s [[Lake Nemi|Nemi]] and [[lake Albano|Albano]] are also reminiscent of the goblet's waters and rim, insofar as they suggest that a &quot;basic visual analogy was at work in Cole's thoughts, an analogy between [these] actual landscapes he had observed and the shape of the water vessels and basins he imagined.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Parry, 135&lt;/ref&gt;

Parry also suggests the &quot;unusual, but not impossible&quot; idea that Cole's ''Goblet'' was a landscape artist's answer to the [[still life]] genre. Visiting the home of his patron [[Luman Reed]], an avid art collector, Cole would have seen a still-life painting &quot;''with Goblet and Lemon''&quot; by the 17th-century Dutch artist [[Willem van Aelst]].  The highlight of that painting is a translucent glass goblet. The similarities are basic, with both paintings having a vertical format and an off-center drinking vessel.

== Provenance ==

Cole likely painted the picture in a fairly short period, given its small size and very thin application of paint. (The canvas is very visible in the accompanying image, viewed at full resolution.) He did so without commission, so the subject was purely his own. He asked $100 for the work, apparently based on the size of the painting—his full-scale landscapes at the time fetched $250 to $500. 

Cole sent ''The Titan's Goblet'' to [[Luman Reed]], though it is not clear whether Reed owned it or simply reviewed it. The work was exhibited at the [[National Academy of Design]] in 1834 while owned by James J. Mapes. Artist [[John Mackie Falconer]] owned it by 1863. [[Samuel Putnam Avery]] donated the painting in 1904 to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York.&lt;ref&gt;See the Metropolitan Museum of Art entry for provenance.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Recognized as a unique artwork, ''The Titan's Goblet'' was the only pre-20th-century American painting included at the [[Museum of Modern Art]]'s &quot;Fantastic Art, Dada, Surrealism&quot; exhibition of 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Parry, 123&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Course of Empire''''' is a five-part series of paintings created by [[Thomas Cole]] in the years 1833–36. It is notable in part for reflecting popular American sentiments of the times, when many saw [[pastoralism]] as the ideal phase of human civilization, fearing that empire would lead to gluttony and inevitable decay.  The theme of cycles is also one that Cole returned to frequently, such as in his ''[[The Voyage of Life]]'' series. All the paintings are 39.5&amp;nbsp;inches by 63.5&amp;nbsp;inches (100&amp;nbsp;cm by 161&amp;nbsp;cm) except ''The Consummation of Empire'' which is 51&quot; by 76&quot; (130&amp;nbsp;cm by 193&amp;nbsp;cm).

Cole specifically designed these paintings to be prominently displayed in the picture gallery on the third floor of the mansion of his patron, [[Luman Reed]], at 13 [[Greenwich Street]], [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Series: The Course of Empire|url=http://www.explorethomascole.org/tour/items/69/series/|accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The layout was approximately as shown here, according to Cole's installation diagram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Installation Diagram for the Course of Empire|url=http://www.explorethomascole.org/gallery/items/303|accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was acquired by The [[New-York Historical Society]] in 1858 as a gift of the New-York Gallery of Fine Arts,&lt;ref&gt;[http://emuseum.nyhistory.org:8080/emuseum/view/objects/asitem/search$0040/23/title-asc?t:state:flow=dade77d2-6d87-41b6-8c1d-9644fd46ee6a New-York Historical Society eMuseum]&lt;/ref&gt; and comprises the following works: ''The Course of Empire – The Savage State''; ''The Course of Empire – The Arcadian or Pastoral State''; ''The Course of Empire – The Consummation of Empire''; ''The Course of Empire – Destruction''; and ''The Course of Empire – Desolation''.

[[File:Asher B. Durand - Portrait of Thomas Cole - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Portrait of Thomas Cole'' by [[Asher Brown Durand|Asher B. Durand]], 1837.]]

The series of paintings depicts the growth and fall of an imaginary city, situated on the lower end of a river valley, near its meeting with a bay of the sea.  The valley is distinctly identifiable in each of the paintings, in part because of an unusual landmark:  a large boulder is precariously situated atop a crag overlooking the valley.  Some critics believe this is meant to contrast the immutability of the earth with the transience of man.

A direct source of literary inspiration for ''The Course of Empire'' paintings is [[Byron]]'s ''[[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage]]'' (1812–18).

The first painting, ''The Savage State'', shows the valley from the shore opposite the crag, in the dim light of a dawning stormy day. A hunter clad in skins hastens through the wilderness, pursuing a deer; canoes paddle up the river; on the far shore can be seen a clearing with a cluster of tipis around a fire, the nucleus of the city that is to be.  The visual references are those of Native American life. This painting depicts the ideal state of the natural world. It is a healthy world, unchanged by humanity.

In the second painting, ''The [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadian]] or Pastoral State'', the sky has cleared and we are in the fresh morning of a day in spring or summer. The viewpoint has shifted further down the river, as the crag with the boulder is now on the left-hand side of the painting; a forked peak can be seen in the distance beyond it. Much of the wilderness has given way to settled lands, with plowed fields and lawns visible. Various activities go on in the background: plowing, boat-building, herding sheep, dancing; in the foreground, an old man sketches what may be a geometrical problem with a stick. On a bluff on the near side of the river, a [[megalithic]] temple has been built, and smoke (presumably from sacrifices) arises from it.  The images reflect an idealized, pre-urban ancient Greece. This work shows humanity at peace with nature. The environment has been altered, but not so much so that it or its inhabitants are in danger.

===''The Consummation of Empire''===

The third painting, ''The Consummation of Empire'', shifts the viewpoint to the opposite shore, approximately the site of the clearing in the first painting.  It is noontide of a glorious summer day. Both sides of the river valley are now covered in colonnaded marble structures, whose steps run down into the water. The megalithic temple seems to have been transformed into a huge domed structure dominating the river-bank. The mouth of the river is guarded by two [[wikt:pharos|pharoi]], and ships with lateen sails go out to the sea beyond.  A joyous crowd throngs the balconies and terraces as a scarlet-robed king or victorious general crosses a bridge connecting the two sides of the river in a triumphal procession.  In the foreground an elaborate fountain gushes.  The overall look suggests the height of ancient Rome. The decadence seen in every detail of this cityscape foreshadows the inevitable fall of this mighty civilization.

===''Destruction''===
[[Image:Cole Thomas The Course of Empire Destruction 1836.jpg|thumb|350px|''Destruction''. Oil on canvas, 1836, 39 ½ × 63 ½ in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.explorethomascole.org/tour/items/69 |title=The Course of Empire: Destruction |author= |date= |work= |publisher=ExploreThomasCole |accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The fourth painting, ''Destruction'', has almost the same perspective as the third, though the artist has stepped back a bit to allow a wider scene of the action, and moved almost to the center of the river. The action is the sack  and destruction of the city, in the course of a tempest seen in the distance.  It seems that a fleet of enemy warriors has overthrown the city's defenses, sailed up the river, and is busily firing the city and killing and raping its inhabitants. The bridge across which the triumphal procession had crossed is broken; a makeshift crossing strains under the weight of soldiers and refugees. Columns are broken, fire breaks from the upper floors of a palace on the river bank.

In the foreground a statue of some venerable hero (posed like the [[Borghese Warrior]]) stands headless, still striding forward into the uncertain future.{{efn|The artist name and date 1836 can just be seen on the base of the statue}} In the waning light of late afternoon, the dead lie where they fell, in fountains and atop the monuments built to celebrate the affluence of the now fallen civilization. The scene is perhaps suggested by the [[Vandal]] [[Sack of Rome (455)|sack of Rome]] in 455. On the other hand, a detail in the lower right of &quot;The Consummation of Empire&quot; shows two children fighting, one clad in red and the other in green—the colors of banners of the two contending forces in &quot;Destruction,&quot; which thus might depict a foreshadowed civil war.

===''Desolation''===
[[Image:Cole Thomas The Course of Empire Desolation 1836.jpg|thumb|350px|''Desolation''. Oil on canvas, 1836, 39 ½ × 63 ½ in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.explorethomascole.org/tour/items/71 |title=The Course of Empire: Desolation |author= |date= |work= |publisher=ExploreThomasCole |accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The fifth painting, ''Desolation'', shows the results, years later. We view the remains of the city in the livid light of a dying day. The landscape has begun to return to wilderness, and no human beings are to be seen; but the remnants of their architecture emerge from beneath a mantle of trees, ivy, and other overgrowth. The broken stumps of the pharoses loom in the background. The arches of the shattered bridge, and the columns of the temple are still visible; a single column looms in the foreground, now a nesting place for birds. The sunrise of the first painting is mirrored here by a moonrise, a pale light reflecting in the ruin-choked river while the standing pillar reflects the last rays of sunset. This gloomy picture suggests all empires could be after their fall. It is a harsh possible future in which humanity has been destroyed by its own hands.

This cycle is, unsurprisingly, depressing. It reflects Cole's pessimism and is often seen as a commentary on [[Andrew Jackson]] and the Democratic Party. (Note, for instance, the military hero at the center of &quot;Consummation.&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Kohl, ''The Politics of Individualism: Parties and the American Character in the Jacksonian Era'' (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; However, some Democrats had a different theory of the course of empire. They saw not a spiral or cycle but a continuing upward trajectory. [[Levi Woodbury]], a Democrat and a justice of the United States Supreme Court, for instance, responded to Cole by saying that there would be no destruction in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred L. Brophy, &quot;Property and Progress: Antebellum Landscape Art and Property Law,&quot; ''McGeorge Law Review'' 40 (2009): 601.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Tree of Crows''''' (also known as '''''Raven Tree''''') is an [[oil painting]] of 1822 by the [[German Romantic]] artist [[Caspar David Friedrich]]. Acquired by the [[Musée du Louvre]] in 1975, it has been called one of Friedrich's &quot;most compelling paintings.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Börsch-Supan, 1990, 144&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting depicts a twisted oak tree, bare but for a few dead leaves, seen against an evening sky. An inscription on the back of the canvas refers to the hill at the painting's center as a ''Hünengrab'', or [[dolmen]], a prehistoric burial ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;B&quot;&gt;, Börsch-Supan, 113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;P&quot;&gt;, Pomarède, 446&lt;/ref&gt; In the distance can be seen the ocean, and [[Cape Arkona]]'s chalk cliffs, a favorite subject of Friedrich's.&lt;ref name=&quot;B&quot;&gt;, Börsch-Supan, 113&lt;/ref&gt; Two crows are perched on the oak, while a flock descends toward it. In the darkened foreground are a hacked trunk and the upright stump of another oak.

The oak is based on a drawing dated 3 May 1809, to which Friedrich added branches at the left and elongated others so as to stretch its forms across the picture plane; the tree in the painting has the overall shape of a rhombus, its web of contorted branches taking on a dramatic presence.&lt;ref&gt;Börsch-Supan, 113-114&lt;/ref&gt; Contrasted with the serene layers of chromatic clouds, the tree's forms have been likened to &quot;many flailing arms.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;B1&quot;&gt;, Börsch-Supan, 114&lt;/ref&gt; The foreground may be seen as representing death, with the distant sky offering consoling beauty and the promise of redemption after life.&lt;ref name=&quot;P&quot;&gt;, Pomarède, 446&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;B1&quot;&gt;, Börsch-Supan, 114&lt;/ref&gt;

A single dominant oak was also the subject of two later vertical compositions painted by Friedrich. In those paintings the trees appear to stand in resignation, whereas that of ''The Tree of Crows'' seems animated by desperation.&lt;ref name=&quot;B1&quot;&gt;, Börsch-Supan, 114&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bailed Up''''' is a [[1895 in art|1895]] painting by Australian artist [[Tom Roberts]]. The painting depicts a [[stage coach]] being held up by [[bushranger]]s in an isolated, forested section of a back road. The painting is part of the collection of the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AGNSW&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Bailed up |url=http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/collection/works/833 |work=Collection |publisher=Art Gallery of New South Wales |accessdate=22 October 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029011447/http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/work/833%2Bbailed-up |archivedate=29 October 2010 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been described by the former Senior Curator as &quot;the greatest Australian landscape ever painted&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SMH&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Hawley |first=Janet |title=Tom Roberts Bailed Up |url=http://www.commercialpainter.com.au/commercial-painter-articles/1996/2/24/tom-roberts-bailed-up/ |accessdate=22 October 2010 |newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald |date=24 February 1996 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706102913/http://www.commercialpainter.com.au/commercial-painter-articles/1996/2/24/tom-roberts-bailed-up/ |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
Roberts painted the work while staying at ''Newstead'' [[sheep station]]&amp;mdash;near [[Inverell, New South Wales]]&amp;mdash;owned by his friend Duncan Anderson. He had earlier painted ''[[The Golden Fleece (painting)|The Golden Fleece]]'', his second painting depicting [[sheep shearing]], while at ''Newstead''.&lt;ref name=AGNSW /&gt; The notorious bushranger [[Captain Thunderbolt]] had been active in the Inverell area more than twenty five years earlier and Roberts conceived an idea of painting a bushranging scene.&lt;ref name=AGNSW /&gt;

Roberts found his location for the painting along the road between ''Newstead'' and ''Paradise'', a neighbouring station. The location was remote, on a flat bend on an uphill stretch of the road, surrounded by &quot;grass trees and a forest of tall gums.&quot;&lt;ref name=AGNSW /&gt; At this spot Roberts, with assistance from the Anderson family, constructed a viewing platform in a tree growing on the slope below the road, thus setting himself up at road level. Roberts painted the [[Cobb and Co]] coach in Inverell and modelled the characters in the painting on people in Inverell and station hands at ''Newstead''. Before starting on the main canvas Roberts &quot;made tiny drawings and an oil sketch of how he wanted the scene to look.&quot;&lt;ref name=AGNSW /&gt;

==Reception==
Once complete, Roberts exhibited ''Bailed Up'' in Sydney and Melbourne. Critical reception to the work was mixed; with comment in the press about &quot;the way the legs of the men, or the skin of the horses had been depicted&quot; among other things. Pearce considered that &quot;[p]erhaps unsatisfactory pictorial resolution was sensed&quot; by collectors. Regardless, for a thirty-year period the painting failed to find a buyer.&lt;ref name=AGNSW /&gt; Roberts reduced his asking price from £275 to 75 [[guinea (British coin)|guineas]] in 1900 but still no buyer could be found.&lt;ref name=AGNSW /&gt;

In 1927, Roberts reworked the painting and the extent of this rework has been difficult to ascertain.&lt;ref name=AGNSW /&gt; Using X-ray photography, art historians now think that Roberts simplified the work considerably, making it flatter and more abstract, in the [[modernist]] style that had come into vogue at that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rewind&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Warren|title=Bailed Up|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/rewind/txt/s1244508.htm|work=Rewind|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=2 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was finally sold for 500 guineas in 1928, purchased by a Sydney solicitor, J. W. Maund. Maund was also a trustee of the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]] and he immediately lent the painting to the gallery&amp;mdash;selling it to them five years later.&lt;ref name=AGNSW /&gt;

En route to an exhibition in Melbourne in 1956&amp;mdash;part of the cultural program of the [[1956 Summer Olympics]]&amp;mdash; the painting fell off the back of a truck. The painting was damaged but successfully restored.&lt;ref name=Rewind /&gt;

In regards to his mural ''Ebb and Flow'' Douglas states: &quot;As I paint simple subjects that remind us of the romance of everyday life, I have designed a very simple flowing landscape. It will focus on a breathtaking sky and a flowing pasture. I feel it is a wonderful depiction of the Midwest and captures the essence of Indiana and its natural beauty. As it will literally flow from panel to panel with the grace of the wind, I am naming it Ebb and Flow.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;''Project Detail: Ebb and Flow'' Public Art Indianapolis.

'''''Landscape, Branchville''''' (also '''''Branchville Lane''''' or '''''Branchville''''') is an oil on canvas painting by [[John Henry Twachtman]]. Painted c. 1888, it is Twachtman's largest known work, and was painted in front of the home of his friend [[J. Alden Weir]].&lt;ref name=&quot;P1&quot;&gt;Peters, 130&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
Close friends, Twachtman and Weir were members of [[The Society of American Artists]], the [[Tile Club]], and the [[Ten American Painters]], and were instructors at the [[Art Students League of New York]]. Twachtman was best man at Weir's wedding, and named his son &quot;Alden&quot; after Weir's middle name.&lt;ref name=&quot;nps.gov&quot;&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/wefa/historyculture/johntwachtman.htm  National Park Service]&lt;/ref&gt; A frequent guest at Weir's farm in [[Branchville (Ridgefield)|Branchville, Connecticut]], in the southeast corner of [[Ridgefield, Connecticut]], Twachtman rented a home nearby in the summer of 1888 to work alongside Weir.&lt;ref name=&quot;nps.gov&quot;&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/wefa/historyculture/johntwachtman.htm  National Park Service]&lt;/ref&gt; Of painting in the country Twachtman wrote Weir: &quot;I feel more and more contented with the isolation of country life. To be isolated is a fine thing and we are then nearer to nature&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nps.gov&quot;&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/wefa/historyculture/johntwachtman.htm  National Park Service]&lt;/ref&gt;

Working together in Branchville, Twachtman and Weir sought to bring the lightness of touch of their watercolors and pastels to oil painting; the import of their experiments was recognized by critics when they exhibited in New York the following winter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flogris.org/learning/foxchase/html/essay_impress.php Florence Griswold Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Landscape, Branchville'' was painted three years after ''Arques-la-Bataille'', the only other canvas by Twachtman of similar size. However, whereas the earlier canvas was painted with the intention of exhibiting at the [[Paris Salon]], Twachtman's rationale for the scale of ''Landscape, Branchville'' is not known.&lt;ref name=&quot;P1&quot;&gt;Peters, 130&lt;/ref&gt; The paintings are exceptional within Twachtman's ouvre: but for a few canvases that extend to 40 or 50 inches in width, most of his notable paintings are less than 30 inches wide.&lt;ref name=&quot;P1&quot;&gt;Peters, 130&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Twachtman John Arques la Bataille.jpg|thumb|left|''Arques-la-Bataille'', [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], the only other painting by Twachtman of similar scale.&lt;ref name=&quot;P1&quot;&gt;Peters, 130&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Description==

The same height and just one inch wider than ''Arques-la-Bataille'', ''Landscape, Branchville'' is a work of vastly different effect, and represents a transitional moment in Twachtman's career.&lt;ref name=&quot;P1&quot;&gt;Peters, 130&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of a consciously formal and carefully arranged composition— ''Arques-la-Bataille'' was painted in the studio from sketches— ''Branchville'' is characterized by a vigorous spontaneity that suggests [[plein-air]] painting.&lt;ref name=&quot;P1&quot;&gt;Peters, 130&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than choosing a subject of natural grandeur for large-scale treatment, as had painters of the [[Hudson River School]], Twachtman painted an apparently unremarkable and intimate view.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, 130-131&lt;/ref&gt;

''Landscape, Branchville'' depicts the landscape, looking to the west, from the front door of Weir's home.&lt;ref name=&quot;P1&quot;&gt;Peters, 130&lt;/ref&gt; Sky comprises the upper third of the painting, with the land carved into diagonals by a winding path. A large tree to the right of center, extending to the top of the canvas, is the sole vertical stanchion. Composed of patches of green and reddish ocher, the ground plane is loosely painted, with the undertone of the canvas showing through toward the bottom of the canvas. The handling gibes with Twachtman's prioritization of breadth over detail.&lt;ref name=&quot;P2&quot;&gt;Peters, 131&lt;/ref&gt; It may also reflect an increasing interest in [[French Impressionism]], examples of which had been exhibited in New York in 1886.&lt;ref name=&quot;P1&quot;&gt;Peters, 130&lt;/ref&gt;

The forms of a similar composition in pastel entitled ''Tree by a Road'' (Cincinnati Art Museum), have been further distilled, and may have been painted after the oil.&lt;ref name=&quot;P1&quot;&gt;Peters, 130&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Twachtman John Spring Landscape.jpg|thumb|right|''Spring Landscape'', c. 1888, pastel on paper. [[Huntington Museum of Art]]. One of numerous pastels Twachtman made in Branchville, and closely related to the etching ''Branchville Fields''.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, 232-233&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Provenance==
Ownership of the painting went from Twachtman to Weir, who once told an art collector &quot;I would sooner lose my right arm than sell one of Johnnie Twachtman's paintings!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nps.gov&quot;&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/wefa/historyculture/johntwachtman.htm  National Park Service]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1957 it was in the possession of Twachtman's son Alden, and in 1968 was bought by Harry Spiro.&lt;ref name=&quot;P1&quot;&gt;Peters, 130&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 ''Landscape, Branchville'' was given to the [[Columbus Museum of Art]], which deaccessioned the painting in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;P2&quot;&gt;Peters, 131&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Rocky Mountains, Lander's Peak''''' is an  1863 [[Landscape art|landscape]] oil painting by the [[German American|German-American]] painter [[Albert Bierstadt]]. It is based on sketches made during Bierstadt's travels with [[Frederick W. Lander]]'s Honey Road Survey Party in 1859. The painting shows [[Lander Peak|Lander's Peak]] in the [[Wind River Range]] of the [[Rocky Mountains]], with an encampment of Native Americans in the foreground. It has been compared to, and exhibited with, ''[[The Heart of the Andes]]'' by [[Frederic Edwin Church]]. ''Lander's Peak'' immediately became a critical and popular success and sold in 1865 for $25,000.

==Background==
[[Hudson River School]] landscape painter Albert Bierstadt (1830–1902) was born in Germany, and, though his family moved to [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]], when he was two, he spent many of his formative years in Europe.&lt;ref name=GAO&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Anderson|first=Nancy|title=Bierstadt, Albert|encyclopedia=Grove Art Online|publisher=Oxford Art Online|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T008819|accessdate=April 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut in an 1858 exhibition, but his breakthrough came in the aftermath of a journey he made the following year. In the spring of 1859, Bierstadt joined the Honey Road Survey Party led by then-colonel [[Frederick W. Lander]].&lt;ref&gt;Hendricks (1964), pp. 333–9.&lt;/ref&gt; He traveled as far as the [[Wind River Range]] in the Rocky Mountains, and made studies for numerous paintings along the way.&lt;ref&gt;Hendricks (1964), p. 338.&lt;/ref&gt; Bierstadt was greatly impressed by the landscape he encountered, and described the Rocky Mountains as &quot;the best material for the artist in the world.&quot;&lt;ref name=Hine196&gt;Hine &amp; Faragher (2007), p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; He had a habit of doing extensive preparation for his work, on occasion making as many as fifty sketches for a single painting.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer &amp; Myers (1999), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860, he exhibited ''Base of the Rocky Mountains, Laramie Peak'' at the National Academy of Design.&lt;ref name=GAO/&gt; His greatest success, however, came with ''The Rocky Mountains, Lander's Peak'', which he exhibited in 1863 at the [[Tenth Street Studio Building]], where he also had a studio.&lt;ref name=Houston69&gt;Houston &amp; Houston (1999), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition and theme==
The painting shows [[Lander Peak|Lander's Peak]], a mountain with a summit of {{convert|10456|ft|m}} in the [[Wind River Range]] in modern-day [[Wyoming]]. The peak was named after Frederick W. Lander on Bierstadt's initiative, after Lander's death in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref name=Met&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/american_paintings_and_sculpture/the_rocky_mountains_lander_s_peak_albert_bierstadt/objectview.aspx?collID=2&amp;OID=20010496|title=The Rocky Mountains, Lander's Peak, 1863|publisher=metmuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one description of the painting, &quot;Sharply pointed granite peaks and fantastically illuminated clouds float above a tranquil, wooded genre scene.&quot;&lt;ref name=Hyde368&gt;Hyde (1993), p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt; The foreground is dominated by the campsite of a tribe of Native Americans. The landscape in the painting is not the actual landscape as it appears at Lander's Peak, but rather an ideal landscape based on nature, altered by Bierstadt for dramatic effect.&lt;ref name=Hine196/&gt;

Bierstadt's painting hit a nerve with contemporary Americans, by portraying the grandeur and pristine beauty of the nation's western wilderness. It was a reference to the idea of [[Manifest Destiny]], where the Rocky Mountains represented both natural beauty, and an obstacle to westward expansion.&lt;ref name=Facos138&gt;Facos (2011), p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of historian Anne F. Hyde: &quot;Bierstadt painted the West as Americans hoped it would be, which made his paintings vastly popular and reinforced the perception of the West as either Europe or sublime Eden.&quot;&lt;ref name=Hyde368/&gt; At the same time, the Native Americans in the foreground gave the scene authenticity, and presented it as a timeless place, untouched by European hands.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (2001), pp. 46–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Depiction of Shoshone Peoples ==
At the forefront of the painting, Bierstadt paints a band of [[Shoshone]] Native peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tfaoi.org/aa/3aa/3aa414.htm|title=For Bierstadt's Eyes Alone, essay by Mary Terence McKay|website=tfaoi.org|access-date=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a review in [[Harper's Weekly]] from March 26, 1864, ''Lander's Peak'', &quot;is purely an American scene, and from the faithful and elaborate delineation of the Indian village, a form of life now rapidly disappearing from the earth, may be called a historic landscape.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/21875508|title=Albert Bierstadt : art &amp; enterprise|last=K.|first=Anderson, Nancy|others=Ferber, Linda S., Wright, Helena, 1946-, Brooklyn Museum., National Gallery of Art (U.S.), Frank and Virginia Williams Collection of Lincolniana (Mississippi State University. Libraries)|isbn=1555950590|edition=First|location=New York|oclc=21875508}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bierstadt illustrated [[Shoshone]] people along with the majestic peaks as a marker of the &quot;sublime&quot; which authors like [[James Fenimore Cooper]], [[John C. Frémont]], and [[Washington Irving]] wrote about.&lt;ref name=&quot;GAO&quot; /&gt; Interestingly, Bierstadt does not include who these people are in his painting title. Unlike [[George Catlin|Catlin]], Bierstadt focused not on the individuality of members of the Shoshone people, rather, his focus was on their relationship with landscape. As Bierstadt scholar Matthew Biagell suggests, as &quot;He placed them, as he placed European peasants in earlier works, in the middle distance so that we witness their presence in a landscape setting rather than focus on their movements.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tfaoi.org/permc/ab.htm|title=Albert Bierstadt, essay by Matthew Biagell|website=www.tfaoi.org|access-date=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1859, [[Eastern Shoshone]] peoples lived in the region now called Western [[Wyoming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.native-languages.org/wyoming.htm|title=Wyoming Indian Tribes and Languages|website=www.native-languages.org|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bierstadt commented on the [[Shoshone]] people he saw in a letter from July 10, 1859 which The Crayon, an art magazine, published in September 1859.&lt;ref name=&quot;B. 1859 280–289&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=B.|last2=N.|first2=B. E.|date=1859|title=Sketchings|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/25527949|journal=The Crayon|volume=6|issue=9|pages=280–289|doi=10.2307/25527949}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The manners and customs of the Indians are still as they were hundreds of years ago, and now is the time to paint them, for they are rapidly passing away, and soon will be known only in history. I think that the artist ought to tell his portion of their history as well as the writer; a combination of both will assuredly render it more complete&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;B. 1859 280–289&quot;/&gt; Bierstadt adds, &quot;We have a great many Indian subjects. We were quite fortunate in getting them, the natives not being very willing to have the brass tube pointed at them. Of course they were astonished when we showed them the pictures they did not sit for; and the best we have taken have been obtained without the knowledge of the parties, which is, in fact the best way to take any portrait&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;B. 1859 280–289&quot;/&gt; The [[Shoshone]] people are depicted on a similar level as the nature of the image, and Biertstadt is attempting to capture an image of them and the Rockies, something which he believes must preserved as a part of history.

==Reception==
[[File:Church Heart of the Andes.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|left|''Lander's Peak'' have often been compared to [[Frederic Edwin Church]]'s ''[[The Heart of the Andes]]''&lt;ref name=GAO/&gt;]]
''Lander's Peak'' was an immediate success; twelve hundred people were invited for the exhibition, and almost a thousand showed up.&lt;ref name=Houston69/&gt; Bierstadt was a shrewd self-promoter as well as a gifted artist, and this was the first of his paintings to be widely promoted with a single-picture exhibition, accompanied by a pamphlet, engravings and a tour.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf (1992), pp. 433–4.&lt;/ref&gt; The painting, with its ten-foot width, was intended both for exhibition halls and the homes of America's emergent millionaire class.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf (1992), p. 434.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1865 it was purchased by British railway entrepreneur James McHenry for the (at the time) high price of $25,000.&lt;ref name=Facos138/&gt; Bierstadt later bought it back, and gave or sold it to his brother Edward, before it was eventually acquired for the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York in 1907.&lt;ref name=Met/&gt;

Comparisons were made between ''Lander's Peak'' and ''[[The Heart of the Andes]]'', a contemporary painting by one of Bierstadt's main rivals in the landscape genre, [[Frederic Edwin Church]].&lt;ref name=GAO/&gt; The two works represented the two great mountain ranges spanning North and South America. At the New York Metropolitan Fair in 1864, held by the [[United States Sanitary Commission]] to raise money for the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] war effort, the two paintings were exhibited opposite each other.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (2001), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lander's Peak'' and ''The Heart of the Andes'' are still exhibited on opposite walls at their current location at the Metropolitan.&lt;ref&gt;Houston &amp; Houston (1999), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most reviews of the painting were positive; one review called it &quot;beyond question one of the finest landscapes ever painted in this country&quot;, adding, &quot;Its artistic merits are in some respects unrivalled: and added to these it has the advantage of being a representative painting of a portion of the most sublime and beautiful scenery on the American Continent.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Houston &amp; Houston (1999), pp. 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt; The painting won a prize at the [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|Exposition Universelle]] in Paris in 1867.&lt;ref name=Facos138/&gt; At the same time, there were also critical voices; in particular, some American [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelites]] found his brushwork wanting. One such critic complained that it would have been better &quot;if the marks of the brush had, by dexterous handling, been made to stand for scrap and fissure, crag and cranny, but as it is, we have only too little geology and too much bristle.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mayer &amp; Myers (1999), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Magpie''''' ({{lang-fr|La Pie}}) is an oil-on-canvas landscape painting by the French [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] [[Claude Monet]], created during the winter of 1868&amp;ndash;1869 near the commune of [[Étretat]] in [[Normandy]]. Monet's patron, Louis Joachim Gaudibert, helped arrange a house in Étretat for Monet's girlfriend [[Camille Doncieux]] and their newborn son, allowing Monet to paint in relative comfort, surrounded by his family.

Between 1867 and 1893, Monet and fellow Impressionists [[Alfred Sisley]] and [[Camille Pissarro]] painted hundreds of landscapes illustrating the natural effect of snow (''effet de neige'').  Similar winter paintings were produced by [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Gustave Caillebotte]], and [[Paul Gauguin]].  Art historians believe that a series of severe winters in France contributed to an increase in the number of winter landscapes produced by Impressionists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rathbone|1999|p=22}}; {{harvnb|Sweeney|1999|pp=23–27}}; For the range of 63 major works produced from 1867–1893, see Moffett et al. 1999.  This arbitrary time period was established for the first ''[[Impressionists in Winter|Impressionists in Winter: Effets de Neige]] '' exhibition, based on historical reports of severe winters collected by curators.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Magpie'' is one of approximately 140 snowscapes produced by Monet.  His first snowscape, ''[[A Cart on the Snowy Road at Honfleur]]'', was painted sometime in either 1865 or 1867, followed by a notable series of snowscapes in the same year, beginning with the ''[[Road by Saint-Simeon Farm in Winter]]''.  ''The Magpie'' was completed in 1869 and is Monet's largest winter painting.  It was followed by ''[[The Red Cape]]'' (1869–1871), the only known winter painting featuring Camille Doncieux.&lt;ref&gt;Moffett et al. 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The canvas of ''The Magpie'' depicts a solitary black [[magpie]] perched on a gate formed in a [[wattle (construction)|wattle]] [[fence]], as the light of the sun shines upon freshly fallen snow creating blue shadows.  The painting features one of the first examples of Monet's use of [[colored shadow]]s, which would later become associated with the Impressionist movement. Monet and the Impressionists used colored shadows to represent the actual, changing conditions of light and shadow as seen in nature, challenging the academic convention of painting shadows black. This subjective theory of color perception was introduced to the art world through the works of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] and [[Michel Eugène Chevreul]] earlier in the century.

At the time, Monet's innovative use of light and color led to its rejection by the [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]] of 1869. Today, art historians classify ''The Magpie'' as one of Monet's best snowscape paintings.&lt;ref name=&quot;RouartGedo&quot;&gt;Arts Council of Great Britain 1957, p. 43: &quot;Perhaps Monet's greatest snow landscape.&quot;; {{harvnb|Rouart|1958|p=41}}: &quot;This, Monet's finest snowscape...&quot;; {{harvnb|Gedo|2010|p=89}}: &quot;...one of the most magnificent snow scenes in his entire oeuvre...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was privately held until the [[Musée d'Orsay]] acquired it in 1984; it is considered one of the most popular paintings in their permanent collection.

==Background==
{{main|Claude Monet}}
In the late 1850s, French landscape painter [[Eugène Boudin]] (1824&amp;ndash;1898) introduced Monet (1840&amp;ndash;1926) to the art of painting ''[[en plein air]]''—&quot;in the open air&quot;, using natural light. The invention of the collapsible [[metal paint tube]] (1841) and [[easel|portable easel]] brought painting, formerly confined to [[studio]]s, into the outdoors. Boudin and Monet spent the summer of 1858 painting nature together. Like Boudin, Monet came to prefer painting outdoors rather than in a studio, the convention of the time. &quot;If I have become a painter,&quot; Monet said, &quot;I owe it to Boudin.&quot;{{sfn|Rouart|1958|p=24}}
[[File:Monet - The Cart.jpg|thumb|left|''A Cart on the Snowy Road at Honfleur'' (1865 or 1867), Monet's first snowscape.]]
The landscape paintings of Dutch painter [[Johan Barthold Jongkind]] (1819&amp;ndash;1891) influenced both Boudin and Monet and contributed to the development of early Impressionism. After meeting Jongkind in [[Sainte-Adresse]] in 1862,{{sfn|Herbert|1996|p=14}} Monet began to cultivate an interest in Jongkind's perspective on the changing conditions of the landscape. From Jongkind, Monet learned to substitute optical color for [[Local color (visual art)|local color]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mathey|1961|p=59}}: &quot;...Jongkind discovered how the so-called &quot;local color&quot; changes with the seasons...It suddenly came to him that for the artist appearance, not reality, was the determining factor...the only thing that did matter was the atmospheric condition at a given moment. He shared this revelation with Monet, who, in turn, experimented by making two paintings of a road in Normandy from the same vantage point—the first one under a cloudy sky, and the second when the road was covered with snow.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Complementing the teaching I received from Boudin, Jongkind was from that moment my true master,&quot; Monet later reminisced.{{sfn|Isham|2004|p=332}} &quot;It was he who completed the education of my eye&quot;.{{sfn|Heinrich|2000|p=9}} This new way of seeing, a shift from a conceptual to a perceptual approach, formed the basis for Monet's ''[[Haystacks (Monet)|Haystacks]]'' (1890-1891), a series of 25 works showing the effects of dynamic atmospheric conditions over time on a single [[haystack]] [[motif (visual arts)|motif]].

[[Gustave Courbet]] (1819&amp;ndash;1877) had been painting ''effets de neige'', &quot;snow effects&quot;, from as early as 1856,&lt;ref&gt;Courbet, Gustave (1856). ''Trees in the Snow''. National Galleries of Scotland.&lt;/ref&gt; in a landscape style preferred by Japanese, Dutch, and Flemish artists. Influenced by Courbet, Monet painted his first snowscape, ''A Cart on the Snowy Road at Honfleur'' (1865 or 1867).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/index-of-works/notice.html?no_cache=1&amp;nnumid=805 Musée d'Orsay]: &quot;With this choice of theme, Monet was following in the footsteps of Courbet who had tackled snowscapes in a number of genre scenes. But unlike the older painter, whose principal motif remained the stag and the hunter and who produced many anecdotal scenes, Monet painted an almost deserted landscape, where the cart and its occupant play a very minor role.&quot; The painting was originally dated 1865 by Monet.  However, correspondence by painter Alexandre Dubourg points to a later date of 1867.  In {{harvnb|Moffett|1999|p=80}}, Eliza Rathbone notes that the date is disputed by scholars.&lt;/ref&gt; A journalist observed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We have only seen him once. It was in the winter, during several days of snow, when communications were virtually at a standstill. It was cold enough to split stones. We noticed a foot-warmer, then an easel, then a man, swathed in three coats, his hands in gloves, his face half-frozen. It was M. Monet, studying a snow effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|House|1988|p=137}} Published in October 1868, but the anecdote is thought to refer to the previous winter.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
In ''A Cart on the Snowy Road at Honfleur'', Monet avoided the usual hunting genre and motifs used by Courbet. Instead, he focused on light and color in a new way by reducing the number of shades. Monet chose an [[earth tone]] color scheme and increased the number of shades of blue to highlight reflections on the snow.  Monet followed ''A Cart on the Snowy Road at Honfleur'' with a notable series of snowscapes in 1867 including ''[[Road by Saint-Simeon Farm in Winter]]''.

==First Étretat campaign==
In 1867, Monet's girlfriend, Camille Doncieux (1847&amp;ndash;1879), gave birth to their son Jean in Paris. Lacking money, Monet returned to his father's house in [[Sainte-Adresse]] and lived with his aunt, leaving Doncieux and their child in Paris. Monet married Doncieux in 1870. Mme. Louis Joachim Gaudibert, an art collector, became Monet's first patron. Gaudibert helped Monet rent a house in Étretat for Doncieux and Jean in late 1868. Recovering from an episode of depression, Monet joined Doncieux and Jean at the house in Étretat in October, with Doncieux in the role of muse and life model.&lt;ref name=&quot;cdm2&quot;/&gt; By December, Monet was in great spirits, &quot;surrounded by everything that I love&quot;, and began to focus on painting. In a letter to [[Frédéric Bazille]] (1841&amp;ndash;1870), Monet wrote:

[[File:The Luncheon by Claude Monet - Städel - Frankfurt am Main - Germany 2017.jpg|thumb|220px|''The Luncheon'' (1868). Camille and son Jean in Étretat.&lt;ref&gt;For an extended discussion of ''The Luncheon'' (''Le Dejeuner'') and how it fits into the timeline of the first Étretat campaign, see: Wagner, Anne M. (1994) &quot;Why Monet gave up figure painting.&quot; ''Art Bulletin'' '''74''' (4): 612. {{issn|0004-3079}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;I spend my time out in the open, on the shingle beach when the weather is bad or the fishing boats go out, or I go into the countryside which is very beautiful here, that I find perhaps still more charming in winter than in summer and, naturally I work all the time, and I believe that this year I am going to do some serious things.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gedo88&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gedo|2010|p=88}}. See also: George, Serge (1996). ''Claude Monet''. Masterworks Series. Ramboro Books. p. 14. {{ISBN|1-56852-113-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although he enjoyed living with Camille and Jean in Étretat, Monet preferred to paint alone in the countryside. He told Bazille:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Don't you think that directly in nature and alone one does better?...I've always been of this mind, and what I do under these conditions has always been better. One is too much taken up with what one sees and hears in Paris, however firm one may be, and what I am painting here has at least the merit of not resembling anyone...because it will be simply the expression of what I shall have felt, I myself, personally.&lt;ref&gt;Wildenstein, I, 425-26: letter 44, Dec. 1868 as quoted in Isaacson 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During his time in Étretat, Monet completed three paintings of fishing boats,&lt;ref&gt;Includes ''Fishing Boats, Calm Weather'' (Bateaux de Pêche, temps calme) (W 123) and ''Fishing Boats at Sea'' (W 126). See also Rouart 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; one of a rural road,&lt;ref&gt;''Lane in Normandy'' (W 128).&lt;/ref&gt; and, sometime between late 1868 and January or February 1869, ''The Magpie'' ([[Wildenstein Index Number|W]] 133).&lt;ref name=&quot;Laclotte&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Laclotte|first=Michel|year=1986|title=Painting in the Musée d'Orsay|publisher=Scala Publications|isbn=0-935748-72-5}} See also footnote 14 as cited in Herbert 1996, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; Painted five years before the first major Impressionist exhibition in 1874, ''The Magpie'' is one of Monet's 140 winter landscapes,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|May|1999}}: &quot;Over the course of 30 winters, he [Monet] executed some 140 snowy views&quot;; Moffett et al. 1999, p. 55: &quot;...Monet painted the largest number of winter scenes (more than 140) and is the best known impressionist painter of effets de neige. As Monet took advantage of most significant snowfalls, his output of winter landscapes was often more sporadic, with occasional bursts of activity followed by periods without production...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; the largest in its class.&lt;ref&gt;Myers 1998: &quot;...his largest winter painting...&quot;; {{harvnb|Sweeney|1999|p=26}}: &quot;It is Monet's largest and most ambitious snowscape, an essay about light and shadow on snow.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The exact location of the snow scene depicted in ''The Magpie'' is unknown.{{sfn|Rouart|1958|p=41}} [[Ralph T. Coe]] proposed that Monet painted the scene near the Farm Saint-Siméon above the Seine estuary in [[Honfleur]].{{sfn|Coe|1957|p=382}}

==Rejection by the Salon==
Monet submitted ''The Magpie'' and ''Fishing Boats at Sea'' (W 126) to the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] of 1869.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gedo91&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gedo|2010|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both paintings were rejected in April.{{sfn|Tinterow|Loyrette|1994|p=322}} Critic Paul Richard said that the jurors rejected the painting as &quot;too common and too coarse&quot;.{{sfn|Richard|1998}} Monet's experimental use of color and radical departure from the descriptive, academic style surprised the public and probably contributed to its dismissal by the jury.&lt;ref&gt;Musée d'Orsay, ''Claude Monet The Magpie'', 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Monet told French novelist [[Arsène Houssaye]] (1815&amp;ndash;1896), &quot;This rejection has taken the bread from my mouth, and in spite of my low prices, collectors and dealers turn their backs on me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Butler145&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Butler|2008|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; A century later, ''The Magpie'' was acquired by the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2006|url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/fr/collections/catalogue-des-oeuvres/notice.html?nnumid=715|title=Musée d'Orsay: Notice d'Oeuvre|publisher=|quote=1984, acquis par les musées nationaux pour le musée d'Orsay (comité du 08/11/1984, conseil du 14/11/1984, arrêté du 14/12/1984)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became one of the most popular paintings in their permanent collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moffett|1999|p=13}}: &quot;Visitor surveys and sales of postcard and reproductions indicate that it is the most popular single image in the museum&quot;; Also see {{harvnb|Sweeney|1999|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical analysis==
In the painting, a black magpie is perched on a gate in a [[wattle (construction)|wattle]] [[fence]] as sunlight falls on fresh white snow, creating shadows. With no human figures present, the bird on the gate becomes the focus.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Rothkopf in {{harvnb|Moffett|1999|p=84}}; {{harvnb|Mathieu|1987|p=78}}: &quot;In the absence of any human figure, the central feature of the painting is the black bird perched on the gate, which is filled with an almost magical significance&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Howard of [[Manchester Metropolitan University]] called the painting &quot;an extraordinary evocation of the snow-bound chill of a late winter's afternoon. The blueness of the long shadows creates a delicate contrast with the creamy whites of the sky and landscape&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Howard 1989, ''Monet'', p. 33 as quoted in {{harvnb|Meynell|1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Curator Lynn Orr, then of the [[Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco]], noted Monet's interest in the changing light that depended on the hour and the vagaries of the atmosphere:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Orr|1994|p=18}}: &quot;...qualities of light characteristic of different times of day and in different atmospheric conditions.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Unusual weather phenomena, such as snow and mist, fascinated Monet because they altered the chromatic appearance of familiar topography. In such paintings as ''The Magpie'', one of Monet's early masterpieces, form dissolves under the combination of a greatly restricted color range, aerial perspective, and broken brushwork. A virtuoso color performance, the painting is an essay on the variations of white perceptible in the reflection of sun on crisp new snow. Wonderfully abstract passages of flat color, such as the strong violet shades along the fence, are divorced from the spatial realities of the objects portrayed.{{sfn|Orr|1994|p=18}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''The Magpie'' is an early example of Monet's investigation of colored shadows. In this piece, Monet makes use of the [[complementary color]]s of blue and yellow. The shadow produced by yellow sunlight shining on the snow gives the impression of a blue-violet color,&lt;ref name=&quot;rcm3&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Magalhães|2003|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the effect of [[simultaneous contrast]]. French Impressionists popularized the use of colored shadows, which went against the artistic convention of portraying shadows by darkening and [[Colorfulness|desaturating]] the color. Colored shadows can be directly observed in nature, particularly in the type of snow scene presented by Monet.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hardin|1988|pp=50–51}}; {{harvnb|Schlichting|1999|pp=5–6}}; {{harvnb|Moffett|1999|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his study of Impressionism, art historian [[John Rewald]] observed that artists used snowscapes to &quot;investigate the problem of shadows&quot;.{{sfn|Rewald|1961|p=228}} The problem is summarized by Fred S. Kleiner in ''[[Gardner's Art Through the Ages]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;After scrutinizing the effects of light and color on forms, the Impressionists concluded that ''local color''—an object's true color in white light— becomes modified by the quality of the light shining on it, by reflections from other objects, and by the effects juxtaposed colors produce. Shadows do not appear gray or black, as many earlier painters thought, but are composed of colors modified by reflections or other conditions. Using various colors and short choppy brush strokes, Monet was able to catch accurately the vibrating quality of light.{{sfn|Kleiner|2009|p=824}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Monet's use of colored shadows arose from color theories that were popular in the 19th century. German scientist [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] (1749&amp;ndash;1832) published one of the first modern descriptions of colored shadows in his ''[[Theory of Colours]]'' (1810). Goethe attempted to challenge the theory of color propounded by [[Isaac Newton]] (1643&amp;ndash;1727) in his treatise on ''[[Opticks]]'' (1704). Goethe raised questions about subjective and objective color theory and perception, but his intuitive, non-mathematical approach was criticized as unscientific, and his attack on Newton was dismissed as a polemic. The questions Goethe raised about color persisted. Thirty years later, French chemist [[Michel Eugène Chevreul]] (1786&amp;ndash;1889) expanded on Goethe's theory with ''The Principles of Harmony and Contrast of Colors'' (1839).&lt;ref name=&quot;cdm2&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Magalhães|2003|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goethe and Chevreul's colour theory greatly influenced the [[art world]]. It is generally thought that [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Camille Pissarro]] and Monet incorporated elements of these theories into their work.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Roque (1996) questions whether the Impressionists were aware of Chevreul's law of simultaneous contrast. Aside from Pissarro and Seurat, Roque can find no evidence that the Impressionists knew Chevreul's work directly. However, Backhaus et al. (1998) point out that it was possible the early Impressionists were familiar with the work of [[Eugène Delacroix]], who was intimate with Chevreul's color theories. It is generally accepted that as early as the 1860s, Monet was familiar with Delacroix's work and was influenced by his use of color.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georges Seurat]] (1859&amp;ndash;1891) came to prominence in 1886 with his technique of [[pointillism|chromatic division]], a style influenced by the color scheme theories of Chevreul and American physicist [[Ogden Rood]] (1831&amp;ndash;1902).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roque|1996|pp=26–39}}.

==Related work==
Monet's series of 11 paintings depicting ''The Bridge at Argenteuil'' (1874) also explored the use of colored shadows in its portrayal of the blue and purple shadow on the top portion of the bridge.{{sfn|Magalhães|2003|p=12}} Over the years, Monet became more and more obsessed with color and light. When his wife was dying in September 1879, Monet painted her in ''[[Camille Monet on Her Deathbed]]'' (1879), noting the &quot;blue, yellow, grey tones&quot;. Monet told his friend, French statesman [[Georges Clemenceau]] (1841&amp;ndash;1929), that he spent the time &quot;focusing on her temples and automatically analyzing the succession of appropriately graded colors which death was imposing on her motionless face.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clemenceau|first=Georges|year=1926|title=Claude Monet: Les Nymphéas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camille died from cancer at the age of 32. After her death, Monet largely ceased painting people, focusing instead on natural landscapes.{{sfn|Meyers|2011|p=75}} Monet later returned to painting snow and colored shadows with ''[[Grainstacks Snow Effect]]'' (1891).{{sfn|Magalhães|2003|p=26}}

'''''Chichester Canal''''' is a painting by the English [[Romantic art|Romantic]] [[landscape painter]], [[watercolour]]ist and [[printmaker]] [[J. M. W. Turner]]. It was painted in 1828&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/turner-chichester-canal-n00560 Chichester Canal c.1828.] Tate Gallery, 2013. Retrieved 15 May 2013. [https://www.webcitation.org/6GdxZkekp Archived here.]&lt;/ref&gt; and was commissioned by [[George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont]]&lt;ref name=green42&gt;{{cite book |title=The History of Chichester's Canal |last=Green |first=Alan H.J |year=2006 |publisher=Sussex Industrial Archaeology Society |isbn=0-9512036-1-4 | page=42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently housed in the [[Tate Collection]].

The work depicts the [[Chichester Canal]] in Sussex, southern England. The ship is probably a [[collier brig]], as this serene scene had commercial purpose. Its brilliant colours may have been influenced by atmospheric [[volcanic ash|ash]] from the eruption of [[Mount Tambora]] in Indonesia (see also [[Year Without a Summer]]).

'''''View of Toledo''''' (original title ''Vista de Toledo''), is one of the two surviving [[landscapes]] painted by [[El Greco]]. The other,  ''View and Plan of Toledo'' lies at Museo Del Greco, [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], [[Spain]].

''View of Toledo'' is among the best known depictions of the sky in [[Western art]], along with [[Vincent van Gogh]]'s ''[[The Starry Night]]'' and the landscapes of [[J. M. W. Turner]] and [[Claude Monet]], among others. Most notable is the distinct color contrast between the dark and somber skies above and the glowing green hills below. While influenced by the [[Mannerist]] style, El Greco's expressive handling of color and form is without parallel in the history of art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/grec/hd_grec.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In this painting, he takes liberties with the actual layout of Toledo insofar as certain building locations are re-arranged. However, the location of the [[Castillo de San Servando|Castle of San Servando]], on the left, is accurately depicted. El Greco's signature appears in the lower-right corner.

==Style==
Landscape paintings were rare among Spanish paintings of the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] periods. The Council of Trent's ban against landscape painting lends credence to the idea that this work may stand as the first Spanish landscape painting of its time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/renaissance-reformation/mannerism1/a/el-greco-view-of-toledo]&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that this painting's enigmatic symbolism could be related to the mysticism that infused the city during the period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artehistoria.jcyl.es/genios/cuadros/1713.htm 'Vista de Toledo', ArteHistoria. Accedido el 8/11/2010.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918081854/http://www.artehistoria.jcyl.es/genios/cuadros/1713.htm |date=September 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The English art historian David Davies asserts that the philosophies of [[Platonism]] and ancient [[Neo-Platonism]], the works of [[Plotinus]] and [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]], the texts of the Church fathers and the liturgy offer the keys to the understanding of El Greco's style.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies20&quot;&gt;D. Davies, &quot;The Influence of Neo-Platonism on El Greco&quot;, 20 etc.&lt;br&gt;* D. Davies, ''the Byzantine Legacy in the Art of El Greco'', 425–445&lt;/ref&gt; Summarizing the ensuing scholarly debate on this issue, José Álvarez Lopera, curator at the [[Museo del Prado]], Madrid, concludes that the presence of &quot;Byzantine memories&quot; is obvious in El Greco's mature works, though there are still some obscure issues concerning his Byzantine origins needing further illumination.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lopera18-19&quot;&gt;J.A. Lopera, ''El Greco: From Crete to Toledo'', 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Willard Metcalf May Night.png|thumb|300px|''May Night'', 1906, by [[Willard Metcalf]]. Oil on canvas, 99.5 cm x 91.8 cm, [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]], [[Washington, DC]].]]

'''''May Night''''' is a 1906 oil painting by [[American Impressionism|American Impressionist]] [[Willard Metcalf]]. It is a [[nocturne (painting)|nocturne]] depicting the home of [[Florence Griswold]], now the [[Florence Griswold Museum]] in [[Old Lyme]], [[Connecticut]]. It was the first contemporary painting purchased by the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]], and is Metcalf's &quot;most celebrated work.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ge&quot;&gt;Gerdts, et al, 62&lt;/ref&gt;
==Background==
Metcalf arrived at the [[Old Lyme Art Colony]] at the invitation of his friend [[Childe Hassam]], and summered there from 1905 to 1907. During the spring, summer and autumn of 1906 Metcalf enjoyed what was to that point his most productive year, finishing twenty-six paintings.&lt;ref name=&quot;C1&quot;&gt;Chambers, et al, 52&lt;/ref&gt; With greater productivity as a landscape painter came an increased exploration of different themes, seasons, and times of day. One of the themes that Metcalf attempted was the nocturne, a subject which had become popular in the Old Lyme colony of artists. The subject's romantic associations and subtle color harmonies reconciled the opposing tendencies of [[Tonalism]] and [[Impressionism]] within the colony.&lt;ref name=&quot;C2&quot;&gt;Chambers, et al, 116&lt;/ref&gt; By 1903 [[Frank DuMond]] had begun teaching the painting of moonlight subjects to his students in Old Lyme, and the theme was popular as a studio alternative to painting outdoors in poor weather.&lt;ref name=&quot;C3&quot;&gt;Chambers, et al, 46&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1906 Hassam wrote about Metcalf to [[J. Alden Weir]]: &quot;Metty is working hard at a moonlight. We are all doing moonlights. The weather has been so bad that we have been forced to it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;C3&quot;&gt;Chambers, et al, 46&lt;/ref&gt;

Metcalf began painting ''May Night'' in the spring of 1906, and finished it in early September.&lt;ref name=&quot;C4&quot;&gt;Chambers, et al, 53&lt;/ref&gt; The subject is the front lawn and facade of the Griswold House, its Ionic columns seen in an atmospheric moonlight. In the foreground, shadows are cast on the lawn by trees. Touches of warmth are provided by the light emanating from within the house. Two figures are present: One woman walks across the lawn toward the house while another sits on the front porch, each of them clad in long pale dresses, which, for Metcalf biographer Bruce W. Chambers, heighten &quot;the feeling of elegant tranquility.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;C4&quot;&gt;Chambers, et al, 53&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
''May Night'' romanticized the condition of the property, which at the time suffered from peeling paint and uncut shrubbery.&lt;ref name=&quot;C4&quot;&gt;Chambers, et al, 53&lt;/ref&gt; It also acknowledged the centrality of Florence Griswold to the creative community.  According to [[Arthur Heming]], whom Metcalf invited to view the painting soon after it was completed, the figure walking toward the house was intended to be Florence Griswold.&lt;ref name=&quot;C5&quot;&gt;Chambers, et al, 13&lt;/ref&gt; As he admired the painting in Metcalf's studio, Miss Florence entered. Metcalf attempted to give her the painting in return for room and board, and she refused, saying &quot;It's the best thing you've ever done. When you show it in New York, they'll snap it up at once, and everything will be lovely.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;C5&quot;&gt;Chambers, et al, 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;K&quot;&gt;Kain&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;S&quot;&gt;Scanlan&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting soon had a profound impact on Metcalf's career, and on the Old Lyme colony.&lt;ref name=&quot;G&quot;&gt;Gerdts, 196&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;S&quot;&gt;Scanlan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;C6&quot;&gt;Chambers, et al, 14&lt;/ref&gt; It was exhibited in November at the [[St. Botolph Club]] in Boston, and in January 1907 at the Corcoran Gallery's inaugural exhibition of contemporary art. There it was awarded the Clark Gold Medal and $1,000, and was bought by the Corcoran for $3,000, thus becoming the gallery's first purchase of a contemporary American painting.&lt;ref name=&quot;C6&quot;&gt;Chambers, et al, 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;S&quot;&gt;Scanlan&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the publicity from the exhibitions and sale of ''May Night'', Metcalf's reputation, already well established, benefited both financially and critically: &quot;From this time he was an acclaimed master of the Impressionist landscape.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;G&quot;&gt;Gerdts, 196&lt;/ref&gt; After seeing the painting in Boston in November 1906, artist and critic [[Philip Leslie Hale]] wrote &quot;One could hardly get a stronger sense of the beauty and mystery of night and springtime&amp;nbsp;... all changed to something new and strange by the magic of dim reflected light of the moon.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;C2&quot;&gt;Chambers, et al, 116&lt;/ref&gt; A critic in the ''Art Annual'' wrote &quot;It is a little weird, and like a dream, but immensely interesting.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;C2&quot;&gt;Chambers, et al, 116&lt;/ref&gt; 

The effect of Metcalf's new-found prosperity on the Old Lyme colony was chronicled the following year, when [[Lillian Baynes Griffin]], wife of painter [[Walter Griffin (painter)|Walter Griffin]], wrote in the ''Hartford Daily Courant'', &quot;The art colony has steadily grown since the first few painters chose it as a sketching ground, but never before has there been such a sudden demand for every inch of available space as there is this year&amp;nbsp;... Lyme cows are so busy posing for the Art classes that they have hardly time to be milked&amp;nbsp;... One explanation of the remarkable jump Lyme has taken is that Willard Metcalf sold in three days $3,000 worth of Lyme landscapes in the St. Botolph Club last winter. This made Lyme landscapes sound like Standard Oil, and with no less enthusiasm than the gold hunters of '49, the picture makers have chosen Lyme as a place in which to swarm.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;C6&quot;&gt;Chambers, et al, 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;S&quot;&gt;Scanlan&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of ''May Night'' was particularly strong: &quot;Suddenly everyone wanted to paint his own ''May Night''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;C7&quot;&gt;Chambers, et al, 59&lt;/ref&gt; Among the artists painting versions of the theme in 1907 were [[Will Howe Foote]] and Metcalf's former student Robert Nisbet,&lt;ref name=&quot;C7&quot;&gt;Chambers, et al, 59&lt;/ref&gt; who eloped with Metcalf's wife Marguerite in July of that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;K&quot;&gt;Kain&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;C8&quot;&gt;Chambers, et al, 63&lt;/ref&gt; 

''May Night'' was the centerpiece of a 2005 exhibition of Metcalf's works at the Florence Griswold Museum.&lt;ref name=&quot;K&quot;&gt;Kain&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrently, an eponymously titled song was featured in a musical inspired by Florence Griswold.&lt;ref name=&quot;K&quot;&gt;Kain&lt;/ref&gt;

''''' The Shortening Winter's Day Is Near a Close (sometimes known as Beneath the Snow Encumbered Branches)''''' is a 1901 oil on canvas work by Scottish painter [[Joseph Farquharson]]. Its whereabouts were unknown between it going on public display in 1901 and the 1960s, when it was bought by a private collector. It reappeared on public display again in 2008, when it was sold at auction, selling for over twice its initial estimate to private hands in Scotland. It is currently held at Lady Lever Art Gallery, Liverpool, England (Accession Number LL3152)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/ladylever/collections/paintings/gallery4/shortening.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; with the title: The Shortening Winter's Day Is Near a Close.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/picture-of-month/displayPicture.aspx?id=84&lt;/ref&gt; It has become well known, as its likeness is used on a popular [[Hallmark Cards|Hallmark]] [[Christmas card]].

==Background==
Painter and [[Laird]] [[Joseph Farquharson]] owned a {{convert|20000|acre|ha|adj=on|lk=out}} estate at Finzean, Royal Deeside, [[Aberdeenshire]], where he enjoyed painting wintery scenes, particularly of sheep. This in turn had led to his nickname of &quot;Frozen Mutton Farquharson&quot;.&lt;ref name=pressandjour/&gt;&lt;ref name=dailymailpaintingfound&gt;{{cite news|first=Andy|last=Dolan|title= Painting that inspired iconic Christmas card is found hanging in pensioner's home... and it's now worth £70,000|url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1090240/Painting-inspired-iconic-Christmas-card-hanging-pensioners-home--worth-70-000.html |accessdate=9 December 2011|newspaper=The Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had a painting hut built on wheels, which contained a stove to keep him from getting too cold whilst he was out painting.&lt;ref name=dailymailpaintingfound/&gt;

Speaking in 2008 before the painting went on sale at auction, Nick Carnow, director at auctioneers Lyon and Turnbull of Edinburgh, said, &quot;Farquharson had a long career but paintings by him of this quality are rare.&quot;&lt;ref name=dailymailpaintingfound/&gt;

==History==
The painting went on display in 1901 at the [[Royal Academy]]. Between then and the 1960s, nothing is known of its location except that it eventually came into the hands of art dealer Richard Green of [[Bond Street]], where it was sold to a private Scottish collector for £1,450.&lt;ref name=dailymailpaintingfound/&gt;&lt;ref name=haynes&gt;{{cite web|title=Haynes Fine Art Pipped To The Post By Strong Private Collector |url=http://www.haynesfineart.com/docs/newsletters/December2008Newsletter.pdf|accessdate=9 December 2011|publisher=Haynes Fine Art|date=December 2008|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Card company [[WN Sharpe]] purchased the rights to use the painting in greetings cards in the 1970s. The company later was acquired by the [[Hallmark Cards]] company, which continues to own these rights. In 2008, Hallmark's Jo Marchbank said, &quot;This painting is one of our most popular Christmas cards. It is probably something to do with the unique atmosphere Farquharson creates, the dramatic yet subtle depiction of a winter landscape.&quot;&lt;ref name=dailymailpaintingfound/&gt; Over the course of its use as a design on Christmas cards, it is thought to have been reproduced hundreds of thousands of times.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;

The painting was resold at auction in 2008, having hung in its owner's sitting room since she originally purchased it in the 1960s. She had decided to sell it because she was moving into smaller living quarters and did not feel that there would be enough room to adequately display the piece.&lt;ref name=haynes/&gt; Sold at Lyon and Turnbull auctioneers in Edinburgh, it was estimated that it would sell for between £50,000 to £70,000,&lt;ref name=pressandjour&gt;{{cite news|first=Gillian|last=Bell|title= Inspirational Painting For Xmas Cards May Fetch Up To £70,000|url=http://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/Article.aspx/962413|accessdate=9 December 2011|newspaper=Press and Journal|date=29 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but sold for more than twice that estimate to another private collector in Scotland for £147,600.&lt;ref name=haynes/&gt;

In December 2009, [[Gyles Brandreth]] presented a piece on the history of the painting for [[BBC One]]’s ''[[The One Show]]''.&lt;ref name=bbconeshow&gt;{{cite web|title=What Did You Think of The One Show?|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theoneshow/2009/12/what-did-you-think-of-the-one-23.shtml|accessdate=9 December 2011|publisher=BBC.co.uk|date=15 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aesthetics==
The painting, like Farquharson’s other landscapes, was painted on his estate at Finzean, Royal Deeside. One of his descendants, Angus Farquharson, later said that he thought he had found the exact spot at Finzean where the painting was created.&lt;ref name=pressandjour/&gt; The painting itself is an oil on canvas work,&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news|first=Richard|last=Savill|title=Christmas card painting to sell for £70,000|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/christmas/3533562/Christmas-card-painting-to-sell-for-70000.html|accessdate=9 December 2011|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=28 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; measuring {{convert|20|in|cm}} high and {{convert|31|in|cm}} wide.&lt;ref name=dailymailpaintingfound/&gt;

The shepherd in the painting was actually an employee of Farquharson whom he had asked to pose for the image. Whilst he was painting he noticed that the model was beginning to turn blue and so offered the man the chance to come inside his painting hut to warm up; the man declined so that Farquharson could finish the painting more quickly.&lt;ref name=dailymailpaintingfound/&gt;

'''''Sunlight and Shadow: The Newbury Marshes''''' (c. 1871-1875) is an [[oil on canvas]] [[landscape art|landscape]] by [[Martin Johnson Heade]] acquired by the [[National Gallery of Art]] in 2010. Heade probably became acquainted with the [[salt marsh]]es near the mouth of the [[Merrimack River]] at [[Newbury, Massachusetts|Newbury]] and [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]] in 1859 through Bishop [[Thomas March Clark]]. ''Sunlight and Shadow'' is one of the earliest of Heade's one hundred plus depictions of [[wetland]]s.  

The National Gallery writes: &quot;[Heade] depicted the tides, meteorological phenomena, and other natural forces that shaped the appearance of the swamp and showed how the land was used for hunting, fishing, and the harvesting of naturally occurring [[salt hay]] ... the painting's primary motif, sunlight and shadow, seen, for instance, in its intricate cloud shadows and the subtle movement from light to dark across the body of the haystack, informs and unites all its visual elements.&quot;

'''''El Rio de Luz (The River of Light)''''' (1887) is an [[oil on canvas]] [[landscape]] by [[Frederic Edwin Church]] acquired by the [[National Gallery of Art]] in 1965. According to the NGA, the work is a &quot;fanciful pastiche&quot; of the many sketches and drawings Church made while traveling in South America in 1857. The NGA notes that &quot;the tightly focused realism, the overall tonal harmony and restrained coloration, and the compositional unity all lend a remarkable cohesiveness to the work.&quot; [[William Earl Dodge, Jr.]] (d. 1903) was the original owner of the work and passed it to his descendants. In 1965, it was given to the [[Preservation Society of Newport County, Rhode Island]], and purchased in December 1965 by the National Gallery of Art. The painting was restored in 1988.

'''''The Cornell Farm''''' (1848) is an [[oil on canvas]] [[landscape art|landscape]] by [[Edward Hicks]]. It was acquired by the [[National Gallery of Art]] in 1964. The picture depicts the farmland and cattle of Pennsylvanian James Cornell. Hicks's inscription along the bottom of the picture reads: &quot;An Indian summer view of the Farm &amp; Stock OF JAMES C. CORNELL of Northampton Bucks county Pennsylvania. That took the Premium in the Agricultural society, October the 12, 1848 Painted by E. Hicks in the 69th year of his age.&quot; The work has been exhibited frequently, with its first display at the [[Bucks County]] Bi-Centennial Celebration, [[Doylestown, Pennsylvania]], in 1882.

The NGA writes, &quot;Having no background in academic art, Hicks employed the direct approach of a primitive or folk painter. The horizontal band of livestock across the foreground, although childlike in its simplicity, clearly presents each prize-winning animal as an individual portrait. Hicks' delight in creating ornamental pattern is evident in the arrangement of fences, while the rich red and bright white of the house and barn symmetrically flank this central landscape. Although the stark silhouettes of figures and buildings seem naive, Hicks softly blended his paints over the orchard to give the impression of space existing well beyond what the eye can see.&quot;

'''''Landscape with Orpheus and Eurydice''''' is a huge 200 × 124 cm (approx 6.5 × 4 feet)  oil-on-canvas by [[French painters|artist]] in the [[Classicism|classical]] style [[Nicolas Poussin]], painted between 1650 and 1653. It is currently held and exhibited at the [[Louvre]] in [[Paris]]

==History==
Nicolas Poussin painted this work for his longtime friend and patron, Jean Pointel, who was a rich banker in Paris. Pointel also was a member of the libertines,{{clarify|date=November 2013}} a circle which Poussin himself frequented. It was in Pointel's collection, which had many works by Poussin, but was stored away after the political climate in Paris changed. In its place Poussin`s landscape with snake and dying man, was hung in Pointel`s private collection.{{cn|date=November 2013}} 

Poussin places the story of [[Orpheus]] in the Campagna Romana (Roman countryside): the [[Castel Sant'Angelo]] and the [[Torre delle Milizie]] (&quot;Tower of the Militia&quot;) figure in this painting, borrowed from the landscape of the [[Rome|Eternal City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Nicolas Poussin's Landscape Allegories|first=Sheila|last= McTighe|publisher=Cambridge University Press| year=1996|
isbn=0-521-48214-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dense smoke pours from a fire which devastates the Castle, and darkens a sky already overcast with sombre clouds. The fall of the light divides the landscape diagonally into bright and dark areas - a division clearly seen on the Torre delle Milizie.&lt;ref&gt;F. Negri Arnoldi, ''Storia dell'Arte'', Fabbri Group (1990), Vol.3, pp.260-262, {{ISBN|978-88-450-0735-4}}. See also, {{citation|last=Mérot|first=Alain|title=Nicolas Poussin|year=1990|publisher=Abbeville Press|isbn=1-55859-120-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Poussin's pictures have darkened, mainly as a result of a red underpainting which has begun to show through the colours. The ''Orpheus'', however, is free of this: it has kept its original transparency even in the darker passages, and the whole painting is in a particularly fine state of preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Nicolas Poussin 1584-1665|first=Richard|last= Verdi|first2=Pierre|last2=Rosenberg|authorlink2=Pierre Rosenberg|publisher=[[Royal Academy]]|year=1995|isbn=0-302-00656-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This work by Poussin remains cryptic and there are various opinions about possible ways to decipher it.

'''''Landscape with the Ashes of Phocion''''' is a 1648 painting, also known as '''''Landscape with the Ashes of Phocion (Collected by His Widow)''''' and '''''The Ashes of Phocion Collected by his Widow''''', by French artist [[Nicolas Poussin]].  [[Phocion]] was an [[Athens|Athenian]] statesman from the 4th century BC. 

&quot;It is a picture about exile. Phocion, an Athenian general, was falsely condemned and executed, and his unburied corpse banished, and taken to the outskirts of [[Megara]] where it was burnt. At the very front his faithful widow gathers up his ashes. Her servant keeps look out. And the outcasts are placed directly below the mighty nucleus of temple-rock-cloud. But nothing in the scene indicates that the civilisation from which they're excluded is itself evil, corrupt or doomed, that they're well out of it. No, their exile from the good life is sheer tragedy. The majestic symphony of the city continues undiminished.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; Tom Lubbock, ''The Independent ''Britains Art Treasures, no.11 &lt;/ref&gt;
The painting is housed at the [[Walker Art Gallery]], part of the [[National Museums Liverpool]], [[England]].&lt;ref name=WAG&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/collections/17c/poussin.aspx|title='Landscape with the ashes of Phocion', Nicolas Poussin, 1648|publisher=National Museums Liverpool|accessdate=2008-09-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914032320/http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/collections/17c/poussin.aspx|archivedate=2008-09-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year Poussin painted a companion piece to ''Landscape with the Ashes of Phocion'', ''[[The Funeral of Phocion]]'', in three versions. Another version of this painting is in the [[Holburne Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/the-ashes-of-phocion-collected-by-his-widow-39423 The Ashes of Phocion Collected by His Widow] in the Holburne Museum on [[Art UK]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Funeral of Phocion''''' is a 1648 [[Landscape art|landscape]] painting, also known as '''''The Burial of Phocion''''', '''''Landscape with the Funeral of Phocion''''' and '''''Landscape with the Body of Phocion Carried out of Athens''''', by the French artist [[Nicolas Poussin]]. [[Phocion]] was an [[Athens|Athenian]] statesman from the 4th century BC. 

Three versions of the painting are known.  These are now housed in [[The Louvre]], [[Paris]]; [[National Museum Cardiff]] and the collections of the [[Glass House]] in [[New Canaan, Connecticut]], [[United States]].&lt;ref name=PJGH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philipjohnsonglasshouse.org/gedownload!/NICOLASPOUSSIN.pdf?item_id=864006&amp;version_id=864007|title= The Philip Johnson Glass House announces the conservation of the Nicolas Poussin painting the single most important work in the collection|publisher=The Philip Johnson Glass House |accessdate=2008-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:View from Dekkersduin.jpg|thumb|The painting Dekkersduin]]
'''Dekkersduin''' is the title of a painting by the Dutch landscape painter [[Jan Hendrik Weissenbruch]] that he made in 1849. The painting offers a panorama view from the old hill in [[The Hague]] called [[Dekkersduin]], for which it is named. The painting offers a now historical view westwards towards [[Scheveningen]] along what would become the &quot;Afvoerkanaal&quot;, a canal to refresh the water in the city canals with water from the dunes. The dune Dekkersduin was a favored place used by Weissenbruch and other painters of the [[Hague School]] because they liked the light effects on the plains. Today the entire area displayed in the painting has been built up and the hill itself has been leveled to make room for homes, offices and parks and only the turn in the canal offers a clue to the original position of the painter.

The painting was purchased from the artist by the [[Teylers Museum]] in [[Haarlem]], where it hangs in the permanent collection.

'''''Morning at Grand Manan''''' is an [[oil painting]] by [[Alfred Thompson Bricher]]. It is part of the permanent collection at the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]], and is currently on view in the Paine Early American Painting Gallery. 

==Description==

Painted along [[Grand Manan|Grand Manan Island]], a favorite vacation spot of the artist in [[New Brunswick]], Canada, Bricher painted the sunrise coming above the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in a tiny [[inlet]] on the coast.&lt;ref name=Catalog&gt;{{cite web|title=Morning at Grand Manan Catalog Entry|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/morning-grand-manan-bricher-alfred-thompson#ext-text-1396|publisher=Indianapolis Museum of Art|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four sailing ships are clearly visible against the pink sky. On the left of the canvas, a sharp, rocky cliff face is seen, breaking up the composition. Bricher clearly depicts each wave rolling onto the beach in minute detail. The sun is positioned a little left of center of the canvas, but is the major focal point, drawing the eye in. Just like the Hudson River painters, Bricher hides his brushstrokes, as if to make the canvas disappear.

==Historical Information==

Alfred Thompson Bricher was part of the [[Luminism (American art style)|American Luminist]] movement, coming out of the [[Hudson River School]]. Much like the [[impressionism|Impressionists]], they were interested in the play of light in [[landscapes]], with Bricher himself being particularly interested in how light played against the ocean. Bricher, in particular, became famous for his [[seascapes]] and depicting the North Atlantic seaboard.&lt;ref name=Catalog /&gt; Bricher is considered the last important luminist painter. ''Morning at Grand Manan'' came at the height of his career, and displayed Bricher's acquisition of European aesthetics into his own paintings.&lt;ref name=Questroyal&gt;{{cite web|last=Abbott|first=William Tylee Ranney|title=Biography|url=http://www.questroyalfineart.com/artist/alfred-thompson-bricher|publisher=Questroyal Fine Art|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Acquisition===

Bricher sold ''Morning at Grand Manan'' to the Vose Gallery in [[Boston]] in 1898. The Indianapolis Museum of Art purchased the painting in 1970 using the Martha Delzell Memorial Fund.

'''''The Valkhof at Nijmegen''''' is an [[oil painting]] by [[Dutch people|Dutch]] artist [[Aelbert Cuyp]], likely painted between 1652 and 1654, during the [[Dutch Golden Age]]. It is currently part of the permanent collection in the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]].

==Description==
''The Valkhof at Nijmegen'' typifies the Dutch landscape. A small boat filled with fisherman wait to capture [[lobsters]]. Two fat cows sit at the bank of the river, with their herder and two guests. The herder's red jacket is the focal point, drawing the eye in and breaking up the muted tones of the rest of the painting. Across the river, the looming [[Medieval]] architecture is bathed in a warm golden light from the seemingly setting sun. Boats float peacefully down the water banks, not disturbing the water. A windmill pokes up from the cliff face. Small, chunky clouds hover peacefully over the bay. Overall, the feelings of peace and tranquility run through the painting, with the stillness of the cattle, people, and water all reflecting the peaceful nature of the painting.

==Historical information==
The town of [[Nijmegen]] was popular with artists during this time period. The city's Medieval history, with the Valkhof having strong patriotic ties. It was the stronghold of [[Gaius Julius Civilis]], an ancient hero who led the Batavians to revolt against the Romans during the 1st-century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nijmegen|url=http://www.livius.org/no-nz/nijmegen/nijmegen.html|publisher=livius.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time, it also paralleled the Dutch's rebellion against [[Spain]] and the [[Habsburg Empire]].

The scene is based on sketches that Cuyp took during this travels to Nijmegen in 1652, however, Cuyp transformed the landscape by using a warm glow, calling to mind [[Italy|Italian]] landscapes. He adopted this style, and it became his signature on his paintings. Later on, Cuyp's work has a profound impact on 19th-century landscape painters, including [[J.M.W. Turner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gallery Label for The Valkhof at Nijmegen|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/valkhof-nijmegen-cuyp-aelbert|publisher=Indianapolis Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Because of the way that Cuyp painted his subjects bathed in light, it is hypothesized that he worked in [[Utrecht]], which took many of its artistic cues from [[Baroque]] Italy. Cuyp dated very few of his paintings, so the date range on this image is an estimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aelbert Cuyp|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/147660/Aelbert-Cuyp|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition===
The painting's oldest provenance history has it in the hands of the Dukes of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, since at least 1826. It was sold in April 1937 to art historian/dealer Eduard Plietzsch. It was sold by the Galarie St. Lucas in Vienna in July of that year. ''The Valkhof'' became part of the John Herron Art Institute, now the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] in 1943, after a gift by Caroline Marmon Fesler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Provenance of The Valkhof at Nijmegen|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/valkhof-nijmegen-cuyp-aelbert#mercury-tab-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Konrad Witz - Fischzug Petri.jpeg|400px|thumb|''The Miraculous Draft of Fishes'', 1444. 132cm x 154cm, [[Musée d'Art et d'Histoire]], [[Geneva]].]]

'''''The Miraculous Draft of Fishes''''' is a 1444 [[oil]] on wood panel painting by the [[Swabia|Swabian]] artist [[Konrad Witz]], on view in the [[Musée d'Art et d'Histoire (Geneva)|Museum of Art and History]] (''Musée d'Art et d'Histoire'') in [[Geneva, Switzerland]]. Originally part of a now dismantled altarpiece known as '''''Peter's Altar Table''''', the panel depicts the [[Miraculous catch of fish|miraculous catch of 153 fish]] as reported in the [[Gospel of John]] and shows a scene of the disciples, who had been fishing at the edge of a lake, recognising the stranger who had called out to them from the shore as the resurrected Jesus. [[Saint Peter|Peter]] is shown wading toward Jesus to greet him. In this painting Witz takes the revolutionary step of moving the scene from the biblical [[Sea of Galilee]] to his local area, around [[Lake Geneva]].&lt;ref&gt;Tyner, Stuart. &quot;Searching for the God of Grace&quot;. Pacific Pr Pub Assn, 2006. 164. IBN 0-8163-2152-3&lt;/ref&gt; With this move, Witz was able to base his rendering of the far landscape on his own observation of actual topographical features rather than rely on imaginative interpretation as earlier artists did. He further brought the landscape to the fore of his work; here the range is not simply a footnote seen through a window or detail visible beyond a crucifixion scene. The painting is renowned for its naturalistic representation of the [[Graian Alps]] and the snow-capped peaks of [[Mont Blanc]] and [[Le Môle]] seen in the distance. In this regard the work is the earliest known faithful portrayal of a landscape in European art history.

Detailed landscapes had already been portrayed by [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandist painters]] such as [[Jan van Eyck]], and their characteristic attention to surface textures and rendering the depth of the receding landscape held strong influence over Witz. However these earlier works were neither based on actual geographical areas, or the careful observation evident in this work. In its innovation, the panel is analogous to [[Hans Bornemann]], at the time working in [[Lüneburg]], who also adapted and greatly advanced the Netherlandish method when he began to paint, for the first time, cityscapes that gave a true account of all of the visible features, and not just the most important buildings.&lt;ref name=&quot;b59&quot;&gt;Borchert, 59&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Heiligentaler Altar Detail Lueneburg.jpeg|left|300px|thumb|[[Hans Bornemann]], Detail from the ''Heiligentaler Altar'', c 1445]]
The painting can be seen as close study of the optics of [[Mirror image|reflection]] and the manner in which the form and appearance of objects is distorted reflected on water's surface.&lt;ref&gt;Zirpolo, Lilian. &quot;The A to Z of Renaissance Art&quot;. Scarecrow Press, 2009. 461. {{ISBN|0-8108-6880-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The buildings and rocks to the right are reflected, as are the coloured clothes of the men hauling a net in the small boat. In the foreground the water is so transparent the bed of the lake can be seen, while at the far end of the lake the tone of the water surface dissolves into a silvery expanse. Only the figure of Christ standing at the edge of the shore does not cast a reflection, the implication being that the laws of nature do not apply to the divine.&lt;ref name=&quot;b58&quot;&gt;Borchert, 58&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Looking Down the Yosemite Valley, California''''' is an 1865 painting by the German-American painter [[Albert Bierstadt]] (1830-1902).&lt;ref name=Birm&gt;{{cite web|title=Looking Down Yosemite Valley Returns|url=http://www.artsbma.org/about/current-news/item/403-looking-down-yosemite-valley-returns|publisher=Birmingham Art Museum|accessdate=January 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was Bierstadt’s first large-scale [[Yosemite]] picture, a subject for which he would become well known. It presents a view of one of America’s most scenic spots. Based on sketches made during a visit in 1863, Bierstadt paints the valley from a vantage point just above the [[Merced River]], looking due west with the prospect framed by [[El Capitan]] on the right, and [[Sentinel Rock]] on the left; the spire of [[Middle Cathedral Rock]] is visible in the distance.&lt;ref name=Birm/&gt;

'''''Aurora Borealis''''' is an 1865 painting by [[Frederic Edwin Church]] of the [[aurora borealis]] and the Arctic expedition of Dr. [[Isaac Israel Hayes|Isaac Hayes]].
The painting measures 56 × 84 1/2 in. (142.3 × 212.2&amp;nbsp;cm) and is now owned by the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]].&lt;ref name=Smithson1&gt;{{cite web|title=Aurora Borealis|url=http://www.americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=4806|publisher=[[Smithsonian American Art Museum]]|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Eos|title=Aurora Painting Pays Tribute to Civil War's End|last=Love|first=Jeffrey J.|publisher=American Geophysical Union|volume=96|doi=10.1029/2015EO035713| date=September 2015 |url=https://eos.org/features/aurora-painting-pays-tribute-to-civil-wars-end}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

''Aurora Borealis'' is based on two separate sketches.&lt;ref&gt;Truettner, W.H. (1970). &quot;The Genesis of Frederic Edwin Church's Aurora Boreolis.&quot; ''Art Quarterly'', XXXI, Fall 1968, pp. 266–83.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first incident was an aurora witnessed by Church's pupil, the [[Arctic]] explorer [[Isaac Israel Hayes|Isaac I. Hayes]]. Hayes provided a sketch and description of the aurora borealis display he witnessed one January evening. Coinciding with Hayes' furthest northern movement into what he named Cape Leiber, the aurora borealis appeared over the peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howat|first=John K.|title=Frederic Church|year=2005|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|isbn=0-300-10988-1|pages=120–121|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fQh2gpT0KFIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=ISBN&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Describing the event, Hayes wrote: 
:&quot;The light grew by degrees more and more intense, and from irregular bursts it settled into an almost steady sheet of brightness... The exhibition, at first tame and quiet, became in the end startling in its brilliancy. The broad dome above me is all ablaze... The colour of the light was chiefly red, but this was not constant, and every hue mingled in the fierce display. Blue and yellow streamers were playing in the lurid fire; and, sometimes starting side by side from the wide expanse of the illuminated arch, they melt into each other, and throw a ghostly glare of green into the face and over the landscape. Again this green overrides the red; blue and orange clasp each other in their rapid flight; violet darts tear through a broad flush of yellow, and countless tongues of white flame, formed of these uniting streams, rush aloft and lick the skies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayes|first=Issac Israel|title=The Open Polar Sea: A Narrative of a Voyage of Discovery Towards the North Pole, in the Schooner &quot;United States&quot;|year=1867|publisher=Sampson Low, Son and Marston|location=London|page=194|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ltY35Ap35moC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=snippet&amp;q=ISBN&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description and influences ==

The iconography of the painting suggested personal and nationalistic references. The peak in the painting had been named Mount Church during Hayes's expedition. ''Aurora Borealis'' incorporated details of Hayes' ship, drawn from a sketch he brought back upon returning from his expedition. Contrasting with his earlier works ''The North'' and ''The Icebergs'' (1861), the intact ship highlights Hayes' achievements in navigating this space, as well as the state of the nation in navigating this contentious historical moment. Presenting the ship's safe passage through the eerie experience, Church suggested optimism for the future with a tiny light shining out from the ship's window.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kinsey&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinsey|first=Joni L.|title=History in Natural Sequence: The Civil War Polyptych of Frederic Edwin Church|year=1995|work=Redefining American History Painting, Patricia M. Burnham and Lucretia Hoover Giese (eds.)|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-521-46059-X|pages=172–173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Millard describes Church's paintings as &quot;large in scale and size, sharply horizontal in format&quot; and &quot;...dramatic in subject, but yielding in execution, and tend to exploit both value contrast and continuous tonal transition.&quot; Church's works, including ''Aurora Borealis,'' were completed using small touches of pigment built together through thin applications, leaving the viewer unaware of fracture between strokes. These works are also built around the tones of &quot;ochre, brown, gray going to blue or green, and green&quot; at the expense of the full value of color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Millard|first=Charles|title=American Style and Quality|journal=[[The Hudson Review]]|date=Spring 1978|volume=31|issue=1|pages=163–169|jstor=3850161|doi=10.2307/3850161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Church's landscape conformed to the aesthetic principles of the ''[[picturesque]]'', as propounded by the British theorist [[William Gilpin (clergyman)|William Gilpin]], which began with a careful observation of nature that was then enhanced by particular notions about composition and harmony.

''Aurora Borealis'' and some of Church's other landscape works, such as ''Morning in the Tropics'' (1877), are examples of Church's use of [[Luminism (American art style)|luminism]]. Characteristics of luminism are: a diffuse light, a hazy atmosphere, and a calm view of the land. The luminism painting style is an aspect of the Hudson River School of landscape painting, of which Frederic Edwin Church was a part, and is associated with American landscapes in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Palmer|first=Allison Lee|title=Historical Dictionary of Romantic Art and Architecture|year=2011|publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]]|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=978-0-8108-7473-2|pages=60–62|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4yNBJQHT9LcC&amp;dq=aurora+borealis+1865+AND+church&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of British critic [[John Ruskin]] was also an important influence on Church. 
Ruskin's ''[[Modern Painters]]'' was a five-volume treatise on art that was, according to American artist [[Worthington Whittredge]], &quot;in every landscape painter's hand&quot; by mid-century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=John Ruskin and Artistical Geology in America|author=Wagner, Virginia L.|journal=    [[Winterthur Portfolio]]|volume=23|issue=2/3|date=Summer–Autumn 1988|pages=151–167|doi=10.1086/496374|last2=Ruskin|first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ruskin emphasized the scrutiny of nature&lt;!--the importance of scrutinizing nature? &quot;emphasize scrutiny&quot;/&quot;importance of scrutinizing&quot;—indifferent to this --&gt;, and he viewed art, morality, and the natural world as spiritually unified. Following this theme, the painting displays the landscape in detail at all scales, from the intricate foliage, birds, and butterflies in the foreground to the all-encompassing portrayal of the natural environments studied by Church. The presence of the cross suggests the peaceful coexistence of religion with the landscape.

== Exhibition ==
Completed in New York that winter,&lt;ref name=&quot;Avery&quot;/&gt; ''Aurora Borealis'' was exhibited publicly in London in 1865 as a triumvirate with two paintings of Ecuadoran volcanos ''Cotopaxi'' (his 1862 painting of an eruption)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/americas-moral-volcano/?_r=0|title=America's Moral Volcano|first=Eleanor Jones|last=Harvey|publisher=|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Chimborazo'' (his 1864 reprise of the dormant mountain that had been the subject of his 1858 masterwork ''Heart of the Andes.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinsey|first=Joni L.|title=History in Natural Sequence: The Civil War Polyptych of Frederic Edwin Church|work=Redefining American History Painting, Patricia M.

== Reception and legacy ==
Created at the end of the [[American Civil War]], ''Aurora Borealis'' (1865) was believed to depict the portent of a simultaneously triumphant and desolate [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] victory, its meaning amplified in relation to later works, including ''The After Glow'' (1867) and other works.&lt;ref name=&quot;Avery&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Avery|first=Kevin J.|title=Treasures from Olana: Landscapes|year=2005|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0-8014-4430-6|pages=48–49, 71|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9fTXgbL63XQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA49#v=onepage&amp;q=aurora&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Frederic Edwin Church - Rainy Season in the Tropics - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|''Rainy Season in the Tropics'', 1866.]]
''Aurora Borealis'' (1865) is considered by some scholars to be best understood within a wider [[polyptych]] or multi-paneled grouping; the meanings of the paintings multiply in relation to each other and the harrowing period of American history during which they were created.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kinsey&quot;/&gt;

''Aurora Borealis'' (1865) was associated with ''Rainy Season in the Tropics'' (1866) for two reasons. First, the two paintings marked the completion of the arctic-tropical sequence created with ''[[The Heart of the Andes]]'' (1859) and ''The North'' also known as ''[[The Icebergs]]'' (1861). These pairings drew together popular attention on exploration of the arctic North and the tropical South. The second association between ''Aurora Borealis'' and ''Rainy Season in the Tropics'' was established through their compositions and &quot;in their luminosity,&quot; where each suggested a &quot;renewed optimism in natural and historic events.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kinsey&quot;/&gt;

'''''The Angelus''''' (''L'Angelus'') is an [[oil painting]] by French painter [[Jean-François Millet]], completed between 1857 and 1859.

The painting depicts two peasants bowing in a field over a basket of potatoes to say a prayer, the [[Angelus]], that together with the ringing of the bell from the church on the horizon marks the end of a day's work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gamb&quot;/&gt;

Millet was commissioned by the American would-be painter and art collector [[Thomas Gold Appleton]], who never came to collect it. The painting is famous today for driving the prices for artworks of the [[Barbizon school]] up to record amounts in the late 19th century.

==History==
Millet said: &quot;The idea for The Angelus came to me because I remembered that my grandmother, hearing the church bell ringing while we were working in the fields, always made us stop work to say the Angelus prayer for the poor departed&quot;.&lt;ref name=musee&gt;[http://www.musee-orsay.fr/index.php?id=851&amp;L=1&amp;tx_commentaire_pi1%5BshowUid%5D=339 ''L'Angelus'', Musée d'Orsay]&lt;/ref&gt; Completed between 1857 and 1859, it is an oil painting on canvas. When Appleton failed to take possession, Millet added a steeple and changed the initial title of the work, ''Prayer for the Potato Crop'', to ''The Angelus''.

It depicts two peasants during the potato harvest in [[Barbizon]], with a view of the church tower of [[Chailly-en-Bière]]. At their feet is a small basket of potatoes, and around them a cart and a pitchfork. Various interpretations of the relationship between the two peasants have been made, such as colleagues at work, husband and wife pair, or (as Gambetta interpreted it) farmer and maidservant. An 1889 sales catalogue described them simply as &quot;a young peasant and his companion&quot;. Millet sold ''The Angelus'' after his ''[[The Gleaners]]'' was sold at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] in 1857. About half the size, it brought him less than half the amount he sold ''The Gleaners'' for. ''The Angelus'' was eventually shown the year before Millet's death in [[Brussels]] in 1874, where it was greatly admired by [[Léon Gambetta]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gamb&quot;&gt;Foley, Susan.  [http://www.h-france.net/rude/rudevoliv/FoleyVol4.pdf &quot;A Great and Noble Painting&quot;: Léon Gambetta and the Visual Arts in the French Third Republic] ([[Portable Document Format|PDF format]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Much later, [[Salvador Dalí]] saw a print of this painting in his school and insisted that this was a funeral scene, not a prayer ritual and that the couple were portrayed praying and mourning over their dead infant. Although this was an unpopular view, at his insistence the Louvre X-rayed the painting, showing a small painted-over geometric shape strikingly similar to a coffin by the basket.&lt;ref&gt;[http://americamagazine.org/content/all-things/angelus-work Schneider, Nathan. &quot;The Angelus at Work&quot;, ''America'', March 24, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; It seems possible that Millet originally painted a burial – perhaps a rural version of Courbet's famous painting ''A Burial at Ornans'' (1850) – but then converted it to a recitation of the Angelus, complete with a visible church bell tower.

==Commentary==
At first, the painting was interpreted as a political statement, with Millet viewed as a socialist in solidarity with the workers.
While the painting expresses a profound sense of religious devotion, and became one of the most widely reproduced religious paintings of the 19th century, with prints displayed by thousands of devout householders across France, Millet painted it from a sense of nostalgia rather than from any strong religious feeling. According to Karine Huguenaud, &quot;There is, however, no religious message to the painting: Millet was simply concerned with portraying a ritualised moment of meditation taking place as the dusk rolls in.&quot;&lt;ref name=Huguenaud&gt;[http://www.napoleon.org/en/history-of-the-two-empires/paintings/the-angelus/ Huguenaud, Karine. ''The Angelus'', April 2010, Napoleon.org]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864 Belgian minister Jules Van Praët exchanged it for Millet’s ''Bergère avec son troupeau'' (Shepherd and his flock) and commented dryly, “What can I say? It is clearly a masterpiece, but faced with these two peasants, whose work is interrupted by prayer, everyone thinks they can hear the nearby church bell tolling, and in the end, the constant ringing just became tiresome”.&lt;ref name=Huguenaud/&gt; 

==Provenance==
The painting triggered a rush of patriotic fervour when the Louvre tried to buy it in 1889, and  was vandalized by a madman in 1932.&lt;ref name=musee/&gt;

==Legacy==
A month after the Secretan sale, ''The Gleaners'' was sold for 300,000 francs, and the contrast between the auction prices of Millet's paintings on the art market and the value of Millet's estate for his surviving family led to the ''[[droit de suite]]'' ([[French language|French]] for &quot;right to follow&quot;), a French law that compensates artists or their heirs when artworks are resold. 

The imagery of ''The Angelus'' with peasants praying was a popular sentimental 19th-century religious subject.  Generations later, [[Salvador Dalí]] had seen a reproduction of it on the wall of his childhood school and claimed to have been spooked by the painting. He felt the basket looked like the coffin of a child and the woman looked like a [[praying mantis]]. He was inspired to create his [[Paranoiac-critical method|paranoiac-critical]] paintings ''The Architectural Angelus of Millet'' and ''[[Gala Dalí|Gala]] and the Angelus of Millet Preceding the Imminent Arrival of the Conical Anamorphoses'' in 1933. These were followed two years later by a similar pair of paintings which included a partial reproduction of Millet's ''The Angelus'', called ''The Angelus of Gala'' and ''Archaeological Reminiscence of Millet's Angelus''. In 1938, he published a book ''Le Mythe tragique de l'Angélus de Millet''.&lt;ref&gt;''Le Mythe tragique de l'Angélus de Millet'', by Jean-Jacques Pauvert with plates by Salvador Dalí, 1963, {{ISBN|2844854184}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A Storm in the Rocky Mountains, Mt. Rosalie''''' is an 1866 landscape oil painting by [[German American|German-American]] painter [[Albert Bierstadt]] that was inspired by sketches created on an 1863 expedition.

Bierstadt traveled to the [[Southern Rocky Mountains|Colorado Rocky Mountains]] where he was taken up to the Chicago Lakes beneath [[Mount Evans]]. The painting is named after Bierstadt's mistress and, at the time, his friend's wife, Rosalie Osborne Ludlow. The painting, measuring at {{convert|210.8|xx|361.3|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}, is exhibited at the [[Brooklyn Museum]], who acquired it in 1976.&lt;!--citation needed, though see accession number--&gt;

By the mid-19th century, the U.S. Government had begun sending surveying expeditions into the newly incorporated territories&lt;ref name=wilton229/&gt; of the [[American West]].&lt;ref name=schmidt&gt;Schmidt 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Albert Bierstadt ventured on at least two of these expeditions, which, along with other trips in the West, would inspire an incredible amount of his creative output.&lt;ref name=64hendricks333&gt;Hendricks 1964, p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt; On his first expedition in 1859, he joined U.S. explorer [[Frederick W. Lander]], taking photographs of Native Americans&lt;ref name=wilton229/&gt; and painting field sketches of the landscape.&lt;ref name=palmquist110&gt;Palmquist and Kailbourn 2000, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; They traveled through Kansas, Nebraska,&lt;ref name=wilton229&gt;Wilton and Barringer 2002, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; and into the [[Wind River Range]] of the Rocky Mountains in Wyoming. This expedition resulted in paintings such as ''On the Sweetwater Near the Devil's Gate, Nebraska'';&lt;ref name=64hendricks336&gt;Hendricks 1964, p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sunset Light, Wind River Range of the Rocky Mountains''; ''Thunderstorm in the Rockies'';&lt;ref name=64hendricks338&gt;Hendricks 1964, p. 338.&lt;/ref&gt; and most notably, two works similarly titled ''[[The Rocky Mountains, Lander's Peak]]''.&lt;ref name=wilton230&gt;Wilton and Barringer 2002, pp. 230.&lt;/ref&gt;

''A Storm in the Rocky Mountains, Mt. Rosalie'' was born from sketches created during his second expedition to the West in 1863. The voyage would take Bierstadt to the Colorado and Wyoming Rocky Mountains, then on to Salt Lake City, Utah, and into California, with stops at Lake Tahoe,&lt;ref name=64hendricks344&gt;Hendricks 1964, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt; San Francisco, and Yosemite.&lt;ref name=64hendricks345&gt;Hendricks 1964, p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition ended in Oregon by November 1863. After a journey totaling eight months, both Ludlow and Bierstadt returned to New York on 17 December.&lt;ref name=64hendricks348&gt;Hendricks 1964, p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bierstadt desired to return to the West, &quot;in search of a subject for a great Rocky Mountain picture&quot;,&lt;ref name=byers237&gt;Byers 1890, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; so in April 1863,&lt;ref name=64hendricks339&gt;Hendricks 1964, p. 339.&lt;/ref&gt; he departed [[New York (state)|New York]] with his friend and explorer, [[Fitz Hugh Ludlow]]&lt;ref name=64hendricks339/&gt; and two other gentlemen.&lt;ref name=75hendricks116&gt;Hendricks 1975, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; They met Ludlow's wife, [[Rosalie Osborne]], in [[St. Louis]], Missouri,&lt;ref name=75hendricks118&gt;Hendricks 1975, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; who accompanied them as far as Atchison, Kansas,&lt;ref name=64ludlow&gt;Ludlow 1864.&lt;/ref&gt; the starting point for the [[Overland Trail]] stagecoach.&lt;ref name=70ludlow2&gt;Ludlow 1870, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Emigrants Crossing the Plains, or The Oregon Trail (Albert Bierstadt), 1869.jpg|thumb|right|''Emigrants Crossing the Plains'', 1869. This painting was likely inspired by the 1863 expedition.]]
As they proceeded into and through Nebraska, Bierstadt would continuously sketch the land, weather, animals, and people around him. During this time, their party passed a fifty-[[wagon train]] of German emigrants who were headed to Oregon.&lt;ref name=70ludlow110&gt;Ludlow 1870, pp. 110–111.&lt;/ref&gt; This event most likely inspired several paintings of the [[Oregon Trail]], including ''Emigrants Crossing the Plains'' and ''The Oregon Trail''.&lt;ref name=64hendricks341&gt;Hendricks 1964, p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also during this trip through Nebraska that Bierstadt produced a series of sketches titled ''The Last of the Buffalo'', which were possibly referenced later on for his 1888 painting of the same name.&lt;ref name=64hendricks342&gt;Hendricks 1964, p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt;

While still in the plains, the party stopped at a ranch to enjoy a buffalo hunt. Although Bierstadt did not participate,&lt;ref name=70ludlow62&gt;Ludlow 1870, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; he was excited to paint the hunted animals. One of the men had wounded a bull and called to Ludlow to fetch Bierstadt. Ludlow described Bierstadt's set-up: &quot;[Bierstadt] leapt from the buggy; out came the materials of success following him, and in a trifle over three minutes from his first halt, the big blue umbrella was pointed and pitched, and he sat under it on his camp-stool, with his color-box on his knees, his brush and palette in hand, and a clean board pinned in the cover of his color-box.&quot;&lt;ref name=70ludlow67&gt;Ludlow 1870, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Ludlow and two other men taunted the bull so &quot;that [Bierstadt] may see him in action.&quot;&lt;ref name=70ludlow68&gt;Ludlow 1870, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

The party continued through Nebraska, before following the [[South Platte River]] toward Denver, Colorado.&lt;ref name=70ludlow119&gt;Ludlow 1870, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; It was just after dawn when the expedition driver pointed westward and said, &quot;There are the Rocky Mountains&quot;.&lt;ref name=70ludlow130&gt;Ludlow 1870, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; Ludlow described his first view of the mountain range: &quot;[T]o see an exquisite marine ghost appear, almost evanescent in its faint azure, but still a literal existence which had been called up from the deeps and laid to rest with infinite delicacy and difficulty, then you will form some conception of the first view of the Rocky Mountains.&quot;&lt;ref name=70ludlow130131&gt;Ludlow 1870, pp. 130–131.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colorado Springs===
[[File:Ambulance wagon on the Bull Run battlefield, 1861 (crop).jpg|thumb|right|An example of an ambulance wagon from 1861.]]
Ludlow and Bierstadt's party rested in Denver for several days before deciding on a spontaneous 70-mile diversion to the south to visit the base of [[Pike's Peak]] and the [[Garden of the Gods]] near [[Old Colorado City]]&lt;ref name=70ludlow139/&gt; (now a part of modern-day [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]]). The journey would not have been possible because they lacked suitable vehicles,&lt;ref name=64ludlow/&gt; but [[John Evans (governor)|Governor John Evans]] kindly lent the expedition his ambulance wagon and &quot;a pair of stout serviceable&quot; horses. Bierstadt rode with his color-box alongside the guide, following the ambulance in a [[buckboard]] pulled by a single horse. On 10 June, the six-person party set off after breakfast.&lt;ref name=70ludlow139&gt;Ludlow 1870, p.139.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirty miles into their journey, they arrived at [[Castle Rock, Colorado|Castle Rock]], &quot;a peculiar hill of the butte kind, a single cone, rising abrupt and solitary out of the level plain to the height of about four hundred feet&quot;.&lt;ref name=70ludlow154&gt;Ludlow 1870, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; Ludlow and another man hiked to the top, describing it as &quot;the quietest, sunniest, most satisfying mount of vision we had yet climbed.&quot; Bierstadt stopped long enough to sketch the butte before continuing his way south.&lt;ref name=70ludlow155&gt;Ludlow 1870, pp. 155–156.&lt;/ref&gt;

The expedition spent three days&lt;ref name=70ludlow176&gt;Ludlow 1870, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; at the base of Pike's Peak to explore the Fontaine qui Bouille (now called [[Fountain Creek]]), which allowed the men to bathe&lt;ref name=70ludlow174&gt;Ludlow 1870, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; before beginning their work, making studies and collecting samples of the local geology.&lt;ref name=70ludlow175&gt;Ludlow 1870, pp. 175–176.&lt;/ref&gt; On reaching the actual springs, the men compared the tastes of each spring, created lemon-flavored soda, and bottled pure spring water to later compare with city water.&lt;ref name=70ludlow177&gt;Ludlow 1870, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; The afternoon of their last day was spent in the Garden of the Gods.&lt;ref name=70ludlow178&gt;Ludlow 1870, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; The men enjoyed squeezing into a narrow cavern and reaching &quot;a vault about fifty feet long, ten feet high&quot;, which they examined by candlelight, and comparing the Garden's rock formations to recognizable shapes, including animals and &quot;a statue of Liberty, standing by her escutcheon, with the usual [[Phrygian cap]] on her head.&quot;&lt;ref name=70ludlow179&gt;Ludlow 1870, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; The men were so impressed by the landscape, that &quot;[i]t was a great disappointment to some of our kind friends that our artist [Bierstadt] did not choose the Garden of the Gods for a 'big picture.' It was such an interesting place in nature that they could not understand its unavailability for art.&quot; Ludlow later surmised that, &quot;however impressive it might be outdoors, [the scenery] was absolutely incommunicable by paint and canvas&quot;.&lt;ref name=70ludlow180&gt;Ludlow 1870, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon their return to Denver, Bierstadt, still looking for a mountain subject, was referred to [[William N. Byers]],&lt;ref name=byers237/&gt; founder and editor of the ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'',&lt;ref name=64ludlow/&gt; who considered himself &quot;something of a mountain tramp&quot;. Byers knew the Chicago Lakes&lt;ref name=wilton234&gt;Wilton and Barringer 2002, p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt; would impress the artist. Bierstadt separated from his expedition, and he and Byers rode a buckboard up to [[Idaho Springs]],&lt;ref name=byers237/&gt; located 30 miles west of Denver. Byers would later write, &quot;There we secured saddle animals and two or three donkeys to pack our bedding, provisions, paint-boxes, etc.&quot;&lt;ref name=byers237/&gt; Despite the rainy weather, they headed south from Idaho Springs further into the mountains, with Byers in the lead and Bierstadt behind the pack animals. They followed Chicago Creek through &quot;dense forest&quot; until they emerged into a &quot;beautiful little flower-decked meadow&quot;. Byers rode out of Bierstadt's line of sight so that he could witness the artist's first impression of the valley.&lt;ref name=byers237/&gt;
{{quote|text=Bierstadt emerged leisurely. His enthusiasm was badly dampened, but the moment he caught the view, fatigue and hunger were forgotten. He said nothing, but his face was a picture of intense life and excitement. Taking in the view for a moment, he slid off his mule, glanced quickly to see where the jack was that carried his paint outfit, walked sideways to it and began fumbling at the lash-ropes, all the time keeping his eyes on the scene up the valley.&lt;ref name=byers237238&gt;Byers 1890, pp. 237–238.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Bierstadt told his guide, &quot;I must get a study in colors; it will take me fifteen minutes!&quot; The weather, however deteriorated, was impressive, and the view in front of Bierstadt included storm clouds drifting low over &quot;sharp pinnacles and spires and masses of broken granite&quot;. Rays of sunlight broke through the cloud, and flowing down a mountain were &quot;ribbons of water from the last hard shower [...] reflecting back the sunshine.&quot; Byers patiently waited for his guest to complete his sketch. When finished, Bierstadt asked, &quot;There, was I more than fifteen minutes?&quot; to which Byers replied, &quot;Yes, you were at work forty-five minutes by the watch!&quot;&lt;ref name=byers238&gt;Byers 1890, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

After continuing to Lower Chicago Lake, Bierstadt crossed the valley to sketch the landscape from a different vantage.&lt;ref name=byers238/&gt; Over the duration of their stay, Bierstadt &quot;worked industriously [...], making many sketches in pencil and studies in oil—these latter in order to get the colors and shade.&quot;&lt;ref name=byers240/&gt; One of these studies, ''Mountain Lake'',&lt;ref name=artrenewal/&gt; was painted on the periphery of Lower Chicago Lake, featuring Mount Spalding.&lt;ref name=xmission/&gt; [[William Henry Jackson]] would take a photograph of Lower Chicago Lake ten years later in nearly the same spot that Bierstadt painted his study.&lt;ref name=usgsjackson/&gt;

Byers took Bierstadt to Upper Chicago Lake before climbing &quot;to the crest of the rim of the upper basin and to [[Summit Lake Park|Summit Lake]], and beyond that to the summit of the highest snowy peak in the group&quot;, which is both &quot;the subject [in the painting]&quot; and &quot;is visible from the streets of Denver&quot;.&lt;ref name=byers240&gt;Byers 1890, p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; The peak was unnamed at the time, so Bierstadt christened it &quot;Mount Rosalie&quot;, after Ludlow's wife. Byers believed Bierstadt had named the peak &quot;after one of the loftiest summits of the Alps&quot;.&lt;ref name=wilton234/&gt;&lt;ref name=byers240/&gt;&lt;ref name=75hendricks128&gt;Hendricks 1975, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bierstadt and Byers's return trip to Denver was &quot;uneventful&quot;&lt;ref name=byers240/&gt; and Fitz Hugh Ludlow would get to look at Bierstadt's studies, which he later described as &quot;some of the finest color studies he made along that [mountain] chain—among others an exquisite series of lakes on a mountain to whose very top he ascended with his color-box, a height of over 15,000 feet, or considerably taller than [[Mont Blanc]].&quot;&lt;ref name=64ludlow/&gt; Ludlow marveled at the landscape sketches and their colors and especially of the main peak&lt;ref name=64ludlow/&gt; that Bierstadt had named:
{{quote|text=That glorious roseate mountain stood nameless among the peaks in its virgin vail of snew [''sic'', &quot;veil of snow&quot;]; so Bierstadt, by right of first portrayal, baptized it after one far away from our sides, but very near and dear to our hearts—a gentle nature who had followed us clear to the verge of our Overland wanderings at Atchison, and parted from us bravely lest she should make our purpose fainter by seeming moved. Henceforth that shining peak is Monte Rosa.&lt;ref name=64ludlow/&gt;}}
On 23 June 1863, Bierstadt and Byers left Denver to continue their journey to California. The expedition's two other men would meet up with them at a later point.&lt;ref name=70ludlow194&gt;Ludlow 1870, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rosalie===
[[File:Rosalie Osborne Bierstadt, seated, unknown date, William Kurtz (restored).jpg|thumb|right|''Rosalie Osborne Bierstadt'', unknown date.]]
By 1857, Fitz Hugh Ludlow had become a known [[hashish]] addict and the bestselling author of ''[[The Hasheesh Eater]]''. In 1859, he married Rosalie Osborne&lt;ref name=75hendricks113&gt;Hendricks 1975, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; in her hometown of [[Waterville, New York|Waterville]], New York.&lt;ref name=75hendricks115&gt;Hendricks 1975, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother had reservations about Ludlow,&lt;ref name=75hendricks114&gt;Hendricks 1975, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; who continuously struggled with finances. At one point, Rosalie was forced to write at least one job inquiry for him in a letter that could have been construed as flirtatious.&lt;ref name=75hendricks115116&gt;Hendricks 1975, p. 115–116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bierstadt returned to his studio in [[state of New York|New York]] and, in 1866, completed his oil painting, one of many inspired by field sketches made during that trip.&lt;ref name=palmquist111&gt;Palmquist and Kailbourn 2000, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; He named the painting after his mistress,{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Rosalie Osborne, whom he had married on November 21, 1866.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;!--ref name=75hendricks has date--&gt;

'''''A View of Het Steen in the Early Morning''''', '''''Château de Steen with Hunter''''' or '''''Het Steen''''' is a landscape painting by [[Rubens]], dating to around 1636. 

It measures 131.2&amp;nbsp;cm by 229.2&amp;nbsp;cm and is now in the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]] in London.

A rare example of a work painted for the artist's own pleasure rather than for a commission, it shows a view of the [[Elewijt Castle|Het Steen]] estate near Brussels, which he had acquired in 1635, set in an early-morning autumn landscape. He had initially intended a much smaller painting focussing on the house, using three small oak planks, probably spares from his studio – as the concept developed, seventeen more panels were added.

It has influenced artists including [[John Constable]], during his period working for [[Sir George Beaumont, 7th Baronet|Sir George Beaumont]], who then owned the painting and later donated it to the National Gallery in 1823.

The painting features the first convincing depiction of a [[mackerel sky]].

'''''Sunset at Montmajour''''' is a landscape in [[oil painting|oils]] painted by the Dutch artist [[Vincent van Gogh]] on July 4, 1888.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24014186 |title=New Vincent Van Gogh painting identified |accessdate=9 September 2013|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AFP1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Long-lost Van Gogh painting unveiled in Amsterdam|url=http://www.afp.com/en/news/topstories/long-lost-van-gogh-painting-unveiled-amsterdam|work=AFP|accessdate=9 September 2013|date=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Van Gogh Painting Unveiled in Amsterdam|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/arts/design/new-van-gogh-painting-discovered-in-amsterdam.html?_r=0|publisher=NY Times|accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was painted while the artist was at [[Arles]], France and depicts a landscape of [[garrigue]] with the ruins of [[Montmajour Abbey]] in the background.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot; /&gt; The painting is {{convert|73.3|x|93.3|cm|in|abbr=on}} and was on display from 24 September 2013 until 12 January 2014 as part of an exhibition at the [[Van Gogh Museum]] in Amsterdam.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot; /&gt;

Its authenticity was questioned several times before it was confirmed as a genuine van Gogh work in 2013. It is the first full-sized painting by Van Gogh to be newly confirmed since 1928.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=st&gt;{{cite news|last=Sapa-AFP|title=Long lost Van Gogh discovered|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/thetimes/2013/09/10/long-lost-van-gogh-discovered|accessdate=11 September 2013|newspaper=Sunday Times|date=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The painting was inventoried among [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo van Gogh]]'s collection of his brother's works in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;The painting bears Theo's inventory number: 180.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VGmus/&gt; It was sold in 1901,&lt;ref name=VGmus&gt;{{cite web|title=Van Gogh Museum discovers new painting by Vincent van Gogh: Sunset at Montmajour|url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=330726&amp;lang=en|work=Van Gogh Museum|accessdate=9 September 2013|authorlink=Van Gogh Museum|date=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which there is no enduring record of its ownership or [[provenance]]. The painting seemingly became &quot;lost&quot; though it was purchased shortly thereafter.

In 1908 a [[Norway|Norwegian]] industrialist, [[Christian Nicolai Mustad]], who believed it to be the work of van Gogh,&lt;ref name=AFP1/&gt; purchased and displayed the painting at his home. According to Mustad's family, the French ambassador to [[Sweden]], while a guest at Mustad's home, advised that it probably was not by van Gogh.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot; /&gt; At that time Mustad took it down from display. The painting remained stored in his attic until Mustad's death, when it reappeared as part of his estate.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite web|last=Memmott|first=Mark|title='New' Van Gogh Painting Identified; Was in a Norwegian Attic|url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/09/09/220625774/|date=9 September 2013|publisher=NPR|accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, the painting was shown to staff at the Van Gogh Museum, but it was dismissed as not the work of van Gogh because it was not signed.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot; /&gt; With the development of improved investigative techniques, however, in 2011 a two-year investigation was launched by the Van Gogh Museum to examine the possible authenticity of the painting.&lt;ref name=NYT1&gt;{{cite web|last=Siegal|first=Nina|title=Museum Identifies New Van Gogh Painting in Amsterdam|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/arts/design/new-van-gogh-painting-discovered-in-amsterdam.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=0&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1378733687-TfBqJ4zhlBSFDSOo/0huDw|work=New York Times|accessdate=9 September 2013|date=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was subjected to a detailed investigation of style and materials. It was discovered to have been painted in the same range of paints that appears in works by van Gogh at that period,&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot; /&gt; which led to further research. Among the evidence that confirmed the painting's authenticity was [[The Letters of Vincent van Gogh|a letter]] written by Vincent van Gogh to his brother Theo on 5 July 1888, describing a landscape that he had painted the previous day: 
{{quote|&quot;Yesterday, at sunset, I was on a stony heath where very small, twisted oaks grow, in the background a ruin on the hill, and wheatfields in the valley. It was romantic, it couldn’t be more so, à la [[Adolphe Joseph Thomas Monticelli|Monticelli]], the sun was pouring its very yellow rays over the bushes and the ground, absolutely a shower of gold. And all the lines were beautiful, the whole scene had a charming nobility. You wouldn’t have been at all surprised to see knights and ladies suddenly appear, returning from hunting with hawks, or to hear the voice of an old Provençal troubadour. The fields seemed purple, the distances blue.  And I brought back a study of it too, but it was well below what I’d wished to do.&quot;&lt;ref name= &quot;Letter 636&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title= Letter 636: To Theo van Gogh.

'''''Landscape with the Flight into Egypt''''' is a painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Baroque]] painter [[Annibale Carracci]]. Dating from c. 1604, it remains in the palace for which it was painted in [[Rome]] as part of the collection of the [[Galleria Doria Pamphilj]].

The painting, depicting the biblical New Testament event of the ''[[Flight into Egypt]]'', was commissioned in 1603 by Cardinal [[Pietro Aldobrandini]] for the family chapel in his palace in Rome, later known as [[Palazzo Doria Pamphilj]]. The commission includes six paintings in six [[lunette]]s, which were executed by Carracci and his pupils (including [[Francesco Albani]], [[Domenichino]] and [[Giovanni Lanfranco]]).&lt;ref&gt;Martin, 317&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is frequently regarded as a key work in Baroque [[landscape painting]] and is the &quot;most celebrated example&quot; of the &quot;new landscape style&quot; Carracci developed in Rome of &quot;carefully constructed landscape panoramas&quot;, according to [[Rudolf Wittkower]].&lt;ref&gt;Wittkower, 70&lt;/ref&gt;  For [[John Rupert Martin]] it is &quot;the archetypal classical landscape, later to be emulated with variations by Domenichino, [[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin]] and [[Claude Lorrain|Claude]] ... the small scale of the figures in relation to the spacious natural setting at once establishes a new priority in which landscape takes first place and history second&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;Martin, 60&lt;/ref&gt; though insofar as it is &quot;new&quot;, that is for Italian painting, as such works had been common in Northern painting since [[Joachim Patinir]] began to use the same reversal of scale almost a century before.  The journey of the [[Holy Family]] is echoed by other moving elements including the sheep, birds, cows and the camels on the ridge at left.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, 176&lt;/ref&gt;  

Wittkower sees in it &quot;a heroic and aristocratic conception of Nature tamed and ennobled by the presence of man&quot;, as such works always contain a large man-made feature, here the castle &quot;severely composed of horizontals and verticals&quot; under which the party moves.  They are placed at the meeting of two diagonals represented by the sheep and the river, &quot;thus figures and buildings are intimately blended with the carefully arranged pattern of the landscape&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wittkower, 70&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Kenneth Clark]] mentions the work as an example of the &quot;ideal landscape&quot; driven to promote itself in the [[hierarchy of genres]] by emulating (in the absence of much evidence of what classical landscape painting was like) an essentially literary vision, largely derived from the pastoral poems of [[Virgil]]: &quot;the features of which it is composed must be chosen from nature, as poetic diction is chosen from ordinary speech, for their elegance, their ancient associations, and their faculty of harmonious combination. ''[[Ut pictura poesis]]''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 67&lt;/ref&gt;  Clark's praise of the work is noticeably faint, as it lacks the spirit he finds in [[Giorgione]] and Claude in the same tradition: &quot;At their best, as in the lunettes in the Doria Gallery, Annibale Carracci's landscapes are admirable pieces of picture-making, in which agreeably stylized parts are built up into a harmonious whole. We recognize the science which has gone into the construction of the castle in the centre of the ''Flight into Egypt''... But in the end these eclectic landscapes are of interest only to historians&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 74; see the rest of the chapter for more whole-hearted praise of Giorgione and Claude.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Morning in a Pine Forest''''' ({{lang-ru|Утро в сосновом лесу}}) is a painting by [[Russia]]n artists [[Ivan Shishkin]] and [[Konstantin Savitsky]]. The bears were painted by Savitsky,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spbdnevnik.ru/?show=article&amp;id=3460|format=|script-title=ru:Загадка картин Ивана Шишкина|publisher =Spbdnevnik.ru |author= |accessdate=2009-03-10|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the art collector [[Pavel Tretyakov]] effaced his signature, stating that &quot;from idea until performance, everything discloses the painting manner and creative method peculiar just to Shishkin&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artclassic.edu.ru/catalog.asp?ob_no=19462&amp;cat_ob_no=13014|format=|script-title=ru:Утро в сосновом лесу. 1889. ГТГ|publisher =Artclassic.edu.ru |author= |accessdate=2009-03-10|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the painting is now credited solely to Shishkin.

The ''Morning in a Pine Forest'' turned very popular, being reproduced on various items, including the &quot;Clumsy Bear&quot; chocolates by [[Krasny Oktyabr Open Joint-Stock Company|Krasny Oktyabr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russiantable.com/store/Chocolate-%22Mishka-Kosolapy%22__146-14.html|title=Chocolate &quot;Mishka Kosolapy&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one poll, the painting is the second most popular in Russia behind ''Bogatyrs'' by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shishkin-art.ru/art.php?genre=10&amp;id=269|format=|script-title=ru:Утро в сосновом лесу |publisher = Shishkin-art.ru|author= |accessdate=2009-03-10|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shishkin's similar paintings are the ''Forest in Spring'' (1884) and ''The Sestroretsk Forest'' (1896).

It is believed that Shishkin painted the pine trees near [[Narva-Jõesuu]] in [[Estonia]], where he often liked to rest in summers.&lt;ref name=&quot;õhtuleht&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Vahe|first=Urmas|title=Narva-Jõesuu saab taas Euroopa kaardile|url=http://www.ohtuleht.ee/200770|newspaper=[[Õhtuleht]]|date=2006-07-01|language=Estonian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spring and autumn landscapes''' is a pair of seasonal paintings representing spring and autumn by Japanese artist Hara Zaishō (1813&amp;ndash;1872). Both are currently part of the [[Royal Ontario Museum|Royal Ontario Museum's]] permanent collection, exhibited on Level 1 of the museum in the [[Prince Takamado]] Gallery of Japan.

==Hara Zaishō==
Hara Zaishō (原在照) was the adopted son of Hara Zaimei (原在明), whom he succeeded as the third head of the [[Hara School]] of professional painters. Based in [[Kyoto]], the Hara School served from the late eighteenth through the early twentieth centuries as official artists to the [[Imperial Court in Kyoto|Imperial Court]]. Hara Zaishō contributed several pieces to the [[Kyoto Imperial Palace]] during its reconstruction following a fire in 1854.&lt;ref&gt;Imperial Household Agency&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous of these is a cherry tree motif painted on sliding ''[[fusuma]]'' doors in the ''Sakura-no-ma'' (Cherry Blossom Room).&lt;ref&gt;Martin, 2002, p.307&lt;/ref&gt;

Zaishō’s career spanned the late [[Edo period|Edo]] (1603-1867) and early [[Meiji period|Meiji]] (1868-1912) periods, a time of great change within Japan as a result of its 1854 [[Bakumatsu|opening to the West]]. The Hara School was aligned with the [[Maruyama Ōkyo|Maruyama School]] of painters,&lt;ref&gt;Newboldt &amp; Hanbury-Williams, 1908, p.116&lt;/ref&gt; a movement founded in the late 18th century associated with western-influenced tendencies such as objective realism, unified perspective, shading and contouring.&lt;ref&gt;Screech, 2012, p.259&lt;/ref&gt;

Hara Zaishō is also associated with the pseudonyms Kanran (観瀾) and Yūran (夕鸞).&lt;ref&gt;Kotobank&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genre==
[[File:Springlandscape1.JPG|thumb|120px|border|right|alt=A cherry tree in bloom grows on a mountain side.|''Spring landscape'']]
These two paintings belong to the ''shiki-e'' genre: images depicting changing landscapes through the seasons. It was not uncommon for ''shiki-e'' to take the form of diptychs, with the entire year represented by images of spring and autumn.&lt;ref&gt;Screech, 2012, p.72&lt;/ref&gt; That is the case with this pair of paintings as is indicated by the mirrored positions of the artist’s seal and signature on each scroll rather than both being in the bottom left corner as is usual on individual scrolls.&lt;ref&gt;Screech, 2012, p.71&lt;/ref&gt; The pair is read from right to left, with spring preceding autumn.

These landscapes are [[ink wash painting|''sumi-e'']]—ink paintings—done on silk, a relatively expensive medium reflecting the status of the artist and patron.&lt;ref&gt;Screech, 2012, p.69&lt;/ref&gt; They are mounted as ''kakejiku'' or ''[[kakemono]]'', vertical wall hangings. This type of painting would typically be hung in a ''[[tokonoma]]'' alcove, sometimes foregrounded by a seasonal flower arrangement and decorative incense burner.&lt;ref&gt;Screech, 2012, p.70&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Kakemono]]'' were usually hung low, as they were intended to be viewed while frontally seated at the distance of a ''[[tatami]]'' mat width (approximately 90&amp;nbsp;cm).&lt;ref&gt;Bowie, 2011, p.102&lt;/ref&gt; Although ''kakejiku'' were objects of decoration, their lack of elaboration reflects their secondary purpose as objects to stimulate quiet contemplation.
[[File:Autumnlandscape1.JPG|thumb|120px|left|alt=Hara Zaishō's Autumn landscape hanging scroll.|''Autumn landscape'']] 
This pair of paintings belongs to a period in Japanese art during which depictions of landscape were undergoing reconsideration.  Faced with Japan’s emergence as a nation on the world stage, artists were moving away from classical Chinese conventions to develop a more nativized system of symbolic motifs,&lt;ref&gt;Baird, 2001, p.21&lt;/ref&gt; and treatments of space.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, 1998, p.262&lt;/ref&gt; The cherry blossoms in the spring image and the thatched roof in the autumn landscape tie Zaishō’s works to contemporary Japan rather than to ancient China.

==Style and content==
''Spring Landscape'' features a full moon shining above a solitary cherry tree in full bloom planted on the slope of a mountain. It retains the monochrome style with its refined Chinese associations,&lt;ref&gt;Screech, 2012, p.236&lt;/ref&gt; but adds sparing use of colour in the slight pink of the [[cherry blossom]]s, symbolic of spring,&lt;ref&gt;Screech, 2012, p.42&lt;/ref&gt; of transience and of [[Japan]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;Screech, 2012, p.43.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Autumn Landscape'', Zaishō again depicts a mountain scene, an environment classically associated with the sacred.&lt;ref&gt;Sato, 1984, p.29&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the slopes are flanked by pine trees, often invoked as symbols of longevity and steadfastness in counterpoint to the fleetingness of spring’s cherry blossoms.&lt;ref&gt;Baird, 2001, p.61&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''{{Audio|Vädersolstavlan.ogg|Vädersolstavlan}}''''' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]] for &quot;The Sun Dog Painting&quot;) is an [[Oil painting|oil-on-panel]] [[painting]] depicting a [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|halo]] display, an [[Atmosphere|atmospheric]] [[optical phenomenon]], observed over [[Stockholm]] on April 20, 1535. It is named after the [[sun dog]]s ({{lang-sv|Vädersol}}, &quot;Weather sun&quot;) appearing on the upper right part of the painting. While chiefly noted for being the oldest depiction of Stockholm in colour,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://svt.se/2.52851/1.99963/vadersolstavlan|title=Vädersolstavlan|date=2003-07-10|publisher=[[Sveriges Television]]|accessdate=19 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427045118/http://svt.se/2.52851/1.99963/vadersolstavlan|archivedate=27 April 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is arguably also the oldest Swedish landscape painting and the oldest depiction of sun dogs.

The original painting, which was produced shortly after the event and traditionally attributed to [[Urban målare]] (&quot;Urban [the] Painter&quot;), is lost, and virtually nothing is known about it.  However, a copy from 1636 by [[Jacob Heinrich Elbfas]] held in [[Storkyrkan]] in Stockholm is believed to be an accurate copy and was until recently erroneously thought to be the restored original. It was previously covered by layers of brownish varnish, and the image was hardly discernible until carefully restored and thoroughly documented in 1998–1999.

The painting was produced during an important time in [[History of Sweden|Swedish history]]. The establishment of modern Sweden coincided with the introduction of [[Protestantism]] and the break-up with [[Denmark]] and the [[Kalmar Union]]. The painting was commissioned by the Swedish reformer [[Olaus Petri]], and the resulting controversies between him and King [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav Vasa]] and the historical context remained a well-kept secret for centuries. During the 20th century the painting became an icon for the [[history of Stockholm]] and it is now frequently displayed whenever the history of the city is commemorated.

== Painting ==
The painting is divided into an upper part depicting the halo phenomenon viewed vertically and a lower part depicting the city as it must have appeared viewed from [[Södermalm]] in the late [[Middle Ages]]. The medieval urban conglomeration, today part of the old town [[Gamla stan]], is rendered using a [[bird's-eye view]]. The stone and brick buildings are densely packed below the [[Storkyrkan|church]] and [[Tre Kronor (castle)|castle]], which are rendered in a descriptive perspective (i.e., their size relates to their social status, rather than their actual dimensions). Scattered wooden structures appear on the surrounding rural ridges, today part of central Stockholm. Though the phenomenon is said to have occurred in the morning, the city is depicted in the evening with shadows facing east.&lt;ref name=&quot;GS750-Weidhagen-historik&quot;&gt;Weidhagen-Hallerdt, ''Vädersolstavlan i Storkyrkan, historisk bakgrund''&lt;/ref&gt;

The wooden panel measures 163&amp;nbsp;by&amp;nbsp;110&amp;nbsp;centimetres&amp;nbsp;(64&amp;nbsp;by&amp;nbsp;43&amp;nbsp;inches) and is composed of five vertical deals (softwood planks) reinforced by two horizontal dovetail battens. The battens, together with the rough [[scrub plane]]d back, have effectively reduced warping to a minimum and the artwork is well preserved, with only insignificant fissures and attacks by insects.&lt;ref name=&quot;St-Erik-Rothlind-7&quot;&gt;Rothlind, p 7&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[dendrochronology|dendrochronological]] examination of the panel by doctor Peter Klein at the Institute für Holzbiologie in Hamburg determined that it is made of [[pine]] deals (''[[Scots Pine|Pinus silvestris]]''), the annual rings of which date from various periods ranging from the 1480s to around 1618. The painting can therefore date no further back than around 1620. This is consistent with the year 1636 given on the frame and mentioned in the parish accounts.&lt;ref name=&quot;St-Erik-Rothlind-12-13&quot;&gt;Rothlind, pp 12-13&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[dye]], covering a semi-transparent red-brownish bottom layer, is [[emulsion paint]] containing [[linseed oil]].  The painting was apparently painted detail by detail as no under-painting or preparatory sketches have been discovered, except for marks at the centres of the biggest circles indicating that [[compass (drafting)|compasses]] were used. As a result of this,  the horizon tilts to the right; an [[x-ray]] analysis has shown that the painter tried to compensate for this tilt by altering various elements in the painting, including mountains added along the horizon and the gently leaning spires of the church and the castle. A narrow unpainted border has been left around the image.&lt;ref name=&quot;St-Erik-Rothlind-10&quot;&gt;Rothlind, p 10&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Possible prototypes ===
[[File:Albrecht Altdorfer - Schlacht bei Issus (Alte Pinakothek, München) 2.jpg|thumb|''[[The Battle of Alexander at Issus]]'' by [[Albrecht Altdorfer]], 1529. ([[Alte Pinakothek]], [[Munich]].)]]
No prototypes for the painting are known in Sweden, and while the painting is occasionally associated with the [[Danube school]], much about its stylistic and [[iconography|iconographic]] history remains to be investigated. A possible stylistic prototype is the illustrated Bible of [[Erhard Altdorfer]] (brother of the more famous [[Albrecht Altdorfer]]). Begun in 1530, it was inspired by the works of [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Cranach]] and [[Albrecht Dürer|Dürer]], but also renewed the genre by combining commonplace details with an undertone of approaching disaster. In particular, Altdorfer's [[Apocalypse|apocalyptic]] illustrations for the [[Book of Revelation|Revelation to John]] deliver an evangelic message similar to that of the ''Vädersolstavlan''. Historical documents show that Olaus Petri, who commissioned the painting, combined biblical quotations related to the Apocalypse with the painting hanging in the church. Copies of Erhard Altdorfer's apocalyptic woodcuts may have been available in Stockholm through the German merchant Gorius Holste who lived by [[Järntorget (Stockholm)|Järntorget]] square and who was a friend of both Petri and [[Martin Luther]].&lt;ref name=&quot;St-Erik-Hermelin-48-49&quot;&gt;Hermelin, pp 48-49&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Albrecht Altdorfer 007.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Landscape with a realistic sky by Albrecht Altdorfer 1528. ([[Alte Pinakothek]].)]]
In [[Albrecht Altdorfer]]'s ''[[The Battle of Alexander at Issus]]'', one of the most famous paintings produced by the Danube School, a composition similar to ''Vädersolstavlan'' renders the battle scene in a detailed landscape under a sky crowded with celestial symbols and messages. Just as in ''Vädersolstavlan'', the view is not depicted as it would really appear, but is rather a composite of factual elements as known by the artist. In ''The Battle of Alexander at Issus'' the eastern Mediterranean Sea, Africa, and the Nile River are represented as known from contemporary maps, while the knights and soldiers are dressed in 16th century armours and the battle is depicted as retold in sources from Antiquity.  The frame suspended over the scene, a device which appears in many other [[German Renaissance]] battle scenes, is mirrored by the 17th century inscription in ''Vädersolstavlan''.  In both paintings, Apocalyptic symbols in the sky are given a contemporary political significance. The realistically rendered sky, light, and clouds, in both paintings, are emblematic of the Danube School.&lt;ref name=&quot;St-Erik-Svanberg-70-72&quot;&gt;Svanberg, pp 70-72&lt;/ref&gt;

The lost original painting is attributed to [[Urban Målare]] by tradition.  However, historical sources and other works of art from the early Vasa Era are rare, and this attribution is apparently doubtful.  Furthermore, as the extant painting has proven to be a 17th-century copy, and not as previously believed a restored original, a credible corroboration is unlikely to ever be produced.&lt;ref name=&quot;St-Erik-Svanberg-66-67&quot;&gt;Svanberg, pp 66-67&lt;/ref&gt;

In the parish accounts, the painting is first mentioned in 1636, at which time a &quot;''M. Jacob Conterfeyer''&quot; was recorded as having &quot;renewed the painting hanging on the northern wall&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;quote-parish&quot;&gt;''Dänn 15. October betallt M. Jacob Conterfeyer att hann hafuer förnyat denn taffla huar upå ståår thet himmelsteckn som syntes för hundrade Åhr sedann här i Stockhollm och står på Nårre murenn'' (Rothlind, p 8)&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholarship has convincingly identified [[Jacob Heinrich Elbfas]] (1600–1664), guild master from 1628 and court painter of Queen [[Maria Eleonora of Brandenburg|Maria Eleonora]] from 1634, as the artist responsible.&lt;ref name=&quot;St-Erik-Rothlind-8&quot;&gt;Rothlind, p 8&lt;/ref&gt;  Based on the brief note referencing the painting's &quot;renewal&quot; in 1636, it was long assumed that the extant painting was in fact the original from 1535, and that the work performed on it in the 17th century was little more than restoration of some kind. However, when the painting was taken down in mid-October 1998 to allow a group of experts from various fields to restore and document it, this notion had to be completely reassessed. A [[Dendrochronology|dendrochronological]] investigation showed that the wood used for the panel came from trees cut down in the early 17th century: the painting in question must therefore be a copy and not the restored original.&lt;ref name=&quot;St-Erik-Rothlind-13&quot;&gt;Rothlind, p 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Notwithstanding the excellent state of the wooden panel prior to its 1998 restoration, the painting was unevenly covered with layers of dust and yellowed varnish. This was particularly pronounced in the area of the sky, obscuring many fine details and altering this area's colouring. Once these layers were removed, it was discovered that the original grey-blue sky had been repainted with broad strokes of a deep blue dye mixed with a fixing agent. An analysis of the blue pigments in the painting showed that the original blue colour, still discernible as a bright line above the horizon, was composed of [[azurite]], while the blue pigment in more superficial layers was true [[ultramarine]] or [[lapis lazuli]]. The ultramarine layer has been identified as [[prussian blue]], a pigment which was favoured from the early 18th century onwards. Additional alteration of the painting is well attested in parish accounts; the painting was &quot;varnished and somewhat restored&quot; by the painter Aline Bernard (1841–1910) in 1885, and a second time in 1907 by a Nils Janzon. The latter restoration was probably limited to the addition of a thick layer of varnish.&lt;ref name=&quot;St-Erik-Rothlind-8&quot; /&gt;

When the painting was thus copied in the 17th century from the 16th-century original, the painting was furnished with a [[Baroque]] frame carrying a heart-shaped [[Cartouche (design)|cartouche]]. This cartouche displayed the message:
{{cquote|The twentieth day in the month of April was seen in the sky over Stockholm such signs from almost seven to nine in the forenoon&quot;}}
in [[Latin language|Latin]], repeated in Swedish and [[German language|German]]. In 1885, the frame was repainted in brown by Leonard Lindh, who also modernized the Swedish and German texts and added his signature at the lower right. During the 1907 restoration the frame was repainted yet again, only to be repainted in its original colour twenty years later, at which time the original text was also uncovered.&lt;ref name=&quot;St-Erik-Rothlind-13-14&quot;&gt;Rothlind, pp 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Background ===
In 1523, as the newly elected King of Sweden,&lt;ref name=&quot;historiska-personer&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav Vasa]] had to unify a kingdom which, unlike a modern [[nation-state]], was composed of separate [[Provinces of Sweden|provinces]] not necessarily happy with his reign. He also had to prepare for a potential Danish attack, and resist the influence of German states and merchants with an interest in reintroducing the hegemony of the [[Hanseatic League]] over the Baltic lands.&lt;ref name=&quot;St-Erik-Hermelin-46&quot;&gt;Hermelin, p 46&lt;/ref&gt;  Facing these challenges, the king saw conspiracies everywhere — sometimes correctly — and started to thoroughly fortify his capital while purging it of potential enemies.&lt;ref name=&quot;St-Erik-Hermelin-43-45&quot;&gt;Hermelin, pp 43-45&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after his coronation, Gustav Vasa heard of the reformatory sermons delivered by [[Olaus Petri]] in [[Strängnäs]] and called him to Stockholm to have him appointed councillor in 1524.  When Petri announced his marriage the following year, the solemnity of the celebration infuriated Catholic prelates to the extent Petri was excommunicated, while the king, in contrast, gave his unreserved support.  Although the king and the reformer collaborated initially, they started to pull in different directions within a few years.&lt;ref name=&quot;GS750-Petri-Vasa&quot;&gt;Höijer, ''Olaus Petri och Gustav Vasa''&lt;/ref&gt;  As the king carried out the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] from 1527, [[Catholic church|Catholic]] churches and monasteries were demolished or used for other purposes.  Petri strongly opposed the king's methods of depriving the church of its assets and in his sermons he began to criticize the king's actions.&lt;ref name=&quot;GS750-Weidhagen-historik&quot; /&gt;  While both the king and Petri were thus devoted to both establishing what was to become the Swedish state and the new religious doctrine, they were also involved in domestic struggle for power,&lt;ref name=&quot;St-Erik-Hermelin-42&quot;&gt;Hermelin, p 42&lt;/ref&gt; a situation fuelled by various enemies and [[Counter Reformation]] [[propaganda]].

=== Events ===
[[File:Olaus Petri Vädersol Slottsbacken mars 2007.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of [[Olaus Petri]] in front of [[Storkyrkan]]]]
The primary historical source describing the events following the celestial phenomenon is the minutes of the proceedings from the king's legal process against the reformers Olaus Petri and [[Laurentius Andreae]] in 1539–1540.  The process was originally described in the chronicle of Gustav Vasa written by the clerk and historian [[Erik Jöransson Tegel]] in the early 17th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;St-Erik-Hermelin-42&quot; /&gt;

Sun dogs were apparently well known during the Middle Ages, as they are mentioned in the ''[[Old Farmer's Almanac]]'' (''Bondepraktikan'') which states that the phenomenon forecasts strong winds, and also rain if the sun dogs are more pale than red.&lt;ref name=&quot;UU-Gunnarson&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Petri interpreted the signs over Stockholm as a warning from God and had the ''Vädersolstavlan'' painting produced and hung in front of his congregation.  Notwithstanding this devotion, he was far from certain on how to interpret these signs and in a sermon delivered in late summer 1535, he explained there are two kinds of omens: one produced by the Devil to allure mankind away from God, and another produced by God to attract mankind away from the Devil — one being hopelessly difficult to tell from the other. He therefore saw it as his duty to warn both his congregation, mostly composed of German burghers united by their conspiracy against the king, and the king himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;St-Erik-Hermelin-43-45&quot; /&gt;

However, on his return to Stockholm in 1535, the king had prominent Germans imprisoned and accused Petri of replacing the law with his own &quot;act of faith&quot;.  In response, Petri warned his followers that the lords and princes interpreted his sermons as rebellious and complained about the ease with which punishment and subversion were carried through, while restoring &quot;what rightly and true is&quot; was much harder.  In a sermon published in 1539, Petri criticized the misuse of the name of God &quot;now commonly established&quot;, a message clearly addressed to the king.  Petri also explained to his congregation that the Devil ruled the world more obviously than ever, that God would punish the authorities and those who obeyed them, and that the world had become so wicked that it was irrevocably doomed.&lt;ref name=&quot;St-Erik-Hermelin-43-45&quot; /&gt;

The king's interpretation of the phenomenon, however, was that no significant change was presaged, as the &quot;six or eight sun dogs on a circle around the true sun, have apparently disappeared, and the true natural sun has remained itself&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;quote-Vasa-1&quot;&gt;''icke så platt för skämptt, att thett iw skulle nogett betecknedh hafue, efterty thett syntess sex eller otte wäder soler uti en kreetz kringh om then rette sool, the doch alla synnerligen förginges, och then rette naturlige sool blef doch widh sigh.'' (Hermelin, pp 45-46)&lt;/ref&gt;  He then concluded that nothing was &quot;much different, since the unchristian treason that Anders Hansson and several of that party had brought against His Highness, was not long thereafter unveiled&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;quote-Vasa-2&quot;&gt;''myckett olijkitt, efter thett okristellige landzförrädherij som Anders Hansson och flere of thett partij emot Hans Kon. M:tt förhänder hade, bleff icke longt ther efter uppenbartt ...'' (Hermelin, pp 45-46)&lt;/ref&gt; The king referred to the so-called &quot;Gun Powder Conspiracy&quot; uncovered in 1536, which aimed at murdering him by a blasting charge hidden under his chair in the church. This resulted in various death sentences and expatriations, including Mint Master Anders Hansson who was accused of being a counterfeiter.&lt;ref name=&quot;St-Erik-Hermelin-45-46&quot;&gt;Hermelin, pp 45-46&lt;/ref&gt;

Petri further excited royal disapproval by writing a chronicle describing contemporary events from a neutral point of view.&lt;ref name=&quot;GS750-Olaus-Petri&quot;&gt;Rosell, ''Olaus Petri''&lt;/ref&gt;  Both Olaus Petri and Anders Hansson were eventually sentenced to death as a result of the trial in 1539/1540, but were later reprieved.&lt;ref name=&quot;GS750-Weidhagen-historik&quot; /&gt;  In the end, the king achieved his aim and the appointment of bishops and other representatives of the church was placed under his jurisdiction.
&lt;ref name=&quot;St-Erik-Hermelin-45-46&quot; /&gt;

=== Censorship ===
When Tegel's ''Vasa Chronicle'' was published in 1622, the section describing the king's legal process and death sentences against the reformers was regarded as unfavourable to the Vasa dynasty and was subsequently left out.  The original manuscript, finally published in 1909, was however not the only account of the events. The oldest report, dating from the 1590s, is a handwritten manuscript simply confirming the event, and a publication on meteorological phenomena published in 1608 described the halo in 1535 as &quot;five suns surrounding the right one with its rings as still depicted in the painting hanging in the Great Church&lt;ref name=&quot;quote-Forsius&quot;&gt;''Anno 1535, 1 Aprilis ifrå 7. til 9. om morghonen, såges här i Stockholm 5. Solar omkring den rätte, medh sine Ringar, såsom the än idagh här i Stockholms store Kyrkia på een Tafla stå afmålade.'' (Hermelin, pp 53-54)&lt;/ref&gt;&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;St-Erik-Hermelin-53-54&quot;&gt;Hermelin, pp 53-54&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowledge of the events faded: in 1622 when the Danish diplomat Peder Galt asked for the meaning of the signs in the painting, he could get no replies anywhere in the city. He translated the Swedish text then accompanying the painting to Latin — &quot;''Anno 1535 1 Aprilis hoc ordine sex cœlo soles in circulo visi Holmie a septima matutina usque ad mediam nonam antermeridianam''&quot; — and concluded that the real sun represented Gustav Vasa and the other suns his successors, an assumption he thought confirmed by contemporary Swedish history. Even this confused report was soon forgotten and in 1632 the halo display in the painting was described in a German leaflet as three beautiful rainbows, a ball, and an eel hanging in the sky over the Swedish capital day and night for four weeks in 1520, furthermore interpreted as a prophecy announcing the forthcoming liberation of Protestant Germany by &quot;the Lion from the North&quot; (i.e. King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus Adolphus]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;St-Erik-Hermelin-54-55&quot;&gt;Hermelin, pp 54-55&lt;/ref&gt;

With the publishing of the first Swedish ecclesiastical history in 1642, the interpretation of the painting and the historical details surrounding it found a new path to follow. Relying on a publication from 1620, the sun dogs are said to have appeared first to King [[John III of Sweden|John III]] (1537–1592) on his deathbed - the painting subsequently being produced by the [[Papism|papist]]-friendly king in order to save the souls of the Protestant kingdom - and a second time before King Gustavus Adolphus shortly before his death at the [[Battle of Lützen (1632)|Battle of Lützen]] in 1632.&lt;ref name=&quot;St-Erik-Hermelin-58&quot;&gt;Hermelin, p 58&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1592 date remained the established one until the 19th century. In the 1870s, however, several publications corrected the dating and within a few decades 1535 became the generally accepted date. The painting's correct historical context was finally laid bare with the publication of the censored manuscript from the ''Vasa Chronicle'' in 1909.&lt;ref name=&quot;St-Erik-Hermelin-60-62&quot;&gt;Hermelin, pp 60-62&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, the painting has become emblematic of the [[history of Stockholm]], and as such appears frequently in various contexts. The 1000 [[Swedish krona|kronor]] banknote published in 1989 shows a portrait of King Gustav Vasa, based on a painting from the 1620s, in front of details from ''Vädersolstavlan''. In the arcs of the parhelion is the microtext &lt;small&gt;SCRIPTURAM IN PROPRIA HABEANT LINGUA&lt;/small&gt;, which roughly translates to &quot;Let them have the Holy Scripture in their own language&quot;. This is a quote from a letter written by the king in which he ordered a translation of the Bible into the [[Swedish language]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Riksbanken&quot;&gt;{{cite web

For the restoration of the [[Gamla stan]] metro station in 1998 the artist [[Göran Dahl]] furnished the walls and floors with motifs from various medieval textiles and manuscripts, including the [[Överhogdal tapestries]] and the 14th-century ''[[Nobilis humilis]]'' (''Magnushymnen'') from the [[Orkney Islands]]. ''Vädersolstavlan'' is prominently featured on the eastern wall just south of the platform where the [[terrazzo]] wall depicts the emblematic sun dog arcs interwoven with enlarged fragments of textiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Medieval Stockholm ==
{{wide image|Monteliusvägen panorama 2009a crop.jpg|800px|Panoramic view from Mariaberget in 2009}}
Just as the 1630s replica has proven to be an accurate copy of the lost original,&lt;ref name=&quot;St-Erik-Weidhagen-Hallerdt-36&quot;&gt;Weidhagen-Hallerdt, ''St Eriks årsbok 1999'', p 36&lt;/ref&gt; the panorama has proven to be a surprisingly reliable historical document offering a rare and detailed glimpse of medieval Stockholm. The landscape and a great number of notable buildings are correctly rendered in such great detail, that historical censorship, misinterpretations, and later restorations have not prevented modern research from repeatedly corroborating the painting's accuracy.

In the painting, the medieval city is viewed looking east with the dark waters of [[Riddarfjärden]] in the foreground and the interior of the [[Stockholm archipelago]] in the background. Although the event depicted is said to have occurred in the morning, the city is painted in evening light.

=== The church and the castle ===
[[File:Storkyrkan Tre-kronor Vädersolstavlan.jpg|thumb|250px|Detail showing the palace and the church. Left of the church are the wings of the palace younger than the original painting. On the other side of the church is the palace still under construction.]]
The painting is centred on the [[Storkyrkan]] church, first mentioned in historical records in 1279 and gradually enlarged over the following centuries. In 1468–1496, during the reign of [[Sten Sture the Elder]], its size was doubled — the chapels where transformed into [[aisle]]s, while rounded windows and a taller roof allowed more light into the building. The building in the painting depicts the church as it must have appeared when Gustav Vasa became king — the [[buttress]]es added in the 1550s are not present in the painting, which seem to confirm that the 17th century copy was faithful to the original.&lt;ref name=&quot;St-Erik-Weidhagen-Hallerdt-36&quot; /&gt; The church still exists, although the present exterior is mostly a later [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] design.

[[File:Ivar Los Park pano 070408-detail-palace-and-church.jpg|thumb|left|The church and the palace today. (Detail from the panorama above.)]]
Immediately behind the church is [[Tre Kronor (castle)|Tre Kronor castle]]. Destroyed by fire in 1697 and subsequently replaced by the [[Stockholm Palace]], it was named after the central [[citadel]], a large gun tower emblazoned with the [[Three Crowns]] symbol, known as the first building in Stockholm and a symbol for the Swedish Crown. While it is not known when the symbol was first added to the citadel (it became the national coat of arms in the late 14th century), it was gilded during the 16th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lindgren-17&quot;&gt;Lindgren, ''Varifrån härstammar Tre Kronor-symbolen?'', p 17&lt;/ref&gt; Again, the painting is strictly accurate, as the 1540s enlargement of the tower is not present in the image. The castle's eastern wing, the king's personal residence, was destroyed by fire in 1525 and in letters ten years later the king, burdened by debts of war to [[Lübeck]], expressed his indignation over the fact that the reconstruction was still not completed. In the painting to the right of the church the eastern wing is accurately depicted as under construction, the exposed roof trusses confirming the inconvenience experienced by the monarch.&lt;ref name=&quot;St-Erik-Weidhagen-Hallerdt-25&quot;&gt;Weidhagen-Hallerdt, ''St Eriks årsbok 1999'', p 25&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Storkyrkan Tre kronor Hogenberg 1560s.JPG|thumb|250px|left|Detail from a 1560s copperplate showing the church and the palace as viewed from south. Note the enlarged citadel and the similarity with the western wings in the painting.]]
However, the two western towers left of the church display an unusual detail in the painting. The uniformly proportioned, large, square windows depicted there are associated with the [[Italian Renaissance]], which was introduced in Sweden in 1572 during reconstruction of [[Kalmar Castle]]. While the construction works of Gustav Vasa are poorly documented, the presence of these windows in Stockholm in 1535 is unlikely. It seems more credible that this part of the painting had been damaged before 1632, forcing the copyist to rely on another source. As the two square and crenellated towers in the painting are depicted much as they appear on a copperplate of Stockholm produced by [[Frantz Hogenberg]] around 1560–1570, the painting thus probably renders this part of the castle as it appeared while the reconstruction was still under way, before its completion in the 1580s.&lt;ref name=&quot;St-Erik-Weidhagen-Hallerdt-23-24&quot;&gt;Weidhagen-Hallerdt, ''St Eriks årsbok 1999'', pp 23-24&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Riddarholmen ===
[[File:Riddarholmen Vädersolstavlan.JPG|thumb|250px|Detail showing [[Riddarholmen]] with the pair of defensive towers in the foreground, the tall spire of the Greyfriar's church behind, and the northern city gate in the background]]

The islet in the left foreground, today known as [[Riddarholmen]] (&quot;Knights' Islet&quot;), was during the medieval era known as ''Gråmunkeholmen'' (&quot;[[Greyfriar]]s Islet&quot;) after the [[Franciscan]] monastery located there and in the painting represented as a building with stepped gables and a tall turret at the far side of the islet. Together with other similar institutions, the monastery was closed by the king following the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] although the building was used as a hospital until the mid 16th century. The turret of the monastery was replaced by the cast iron spire of [[Riddarholm Church]] in the 19th century, but the remains of the monastery still exist inside the church and under the surrounding buildings.&lt;ref name=&quot;St-Erik-Weidhagen-Hallerdt-27-28&quot;&gt;Weidhagen-Hallerdt, ''St Eriks årsbok 1999'', pp 27-28&lt;/ref&gt;

The two defensive towers appearing along the near shoreline of the islet are still present, their structures remain intact although their exteriors are considerably altered. The leftmost is [[Birger Jarls torn]] located in the north-western corner of the islet and erroneously named after [[Birger Jarl]], by tradition attributed to be the founder of Stockholm. The other is the so-called ''Vasatornet'' (&quot;Tower of Vasa&quot;), today forming the southern tower of the [[Wrangel Palace]]. For the construction of the towers and other defensive structures, the king used bricks from the monastery ''Klara kloster'' located just north of the city but absent in the painting. Since the monastery is known to have been demolished immediately following the introduction of Protestantism in 1527, the painting is, again, a credible source rendering the city as it appeared in 1535.&lt;ref name=&quot;St-Erik-Weidhagen-Hallerdt-32-33&quot;&gt;Weidhagen-Hallerdt, ''St Eriks årsbok 1999'', pp 32-33&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Helgeandsholmen ===
[[File:Helgeandsholmen Vädersolstavlan.JPG|thumb|250px|Detail showing Helgeandsholmen and the northern city gate. The stepped gable of the charitable institution of the Holy Spirit is behind the Greyfriar's turret. The empty space in front of it was the location for the Johannite monastery.]]
Just behind the Greyfriars turret is the islet of [[Helgeandsholmen]], where the northern city gate and defensive wall were located. Today occupied by the [[Parliament of Sweden|Swedish Parliament]], this islet was named after the charitable institution, ''Helige andens holme'' (&quot;Islet of the Holy Spirit&quot;), located there from around 1300 and discernible in the painting as a building with stepped gables facing an open space perhaps indicating the location of the demolished [[Johannite]] monastery. King Gustav Vasa had all the charitable institutions in the city merged into a single one housed in the former Greyfriars monastery on Riddarholmen, so the monasteries in the painting were all the possession of the crown when the painting was produced.&lt;ref name=&quot;St-Erik-Weidhagen-Hallerdt-32-33&quot; /&gt;

The painting shows a bridge stretching north (left) from the northern city gate to an open space. This is the site of perhaps the oldest river crossing in Stockholm, today replaced by the [[Norrbro]], [[Riksbron]], and [[Stallbron]] bridges.  The latter of these (not present in the painting) is a 19th-century bridge still located on the site of the medieval structure. It connects [[Riksgatan]] passing through the [[Parliament of Sweden|Parliament Building]] on Helgeandsholmen to the square [[Mynttorget]] on [[Stadsholmen]], from where [[Västerlånggatan]] extends it further south.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gatunamn&quot;&gt;{{cite book

=== Southern city gate ===
[[File:Söderport Vädersolstavlan.JPG|thumb|250px|Detail showing the southern city gate. Note the train oil cottages in the upper right corner detailed below.]]
The two defensive towers of the southern city gate appearing in the left foreground, are known to be much older than the painting but their history remains poorly documented.  The outer tower (''Yttre Söderport'') was built on an artificial island in the strait and was rebuilt in front of an expected attack by King [[Christian II of Denmark]] in the late 1520s.  In ''Blodbadstavlan'' (&quot;The [[Stockholm Bloodbath|Bloodbath]] Painting&quot;), an image ten years older than ''Vädersolstavlan'', it appears with a cone-shaped roof seriously damaged during the Danish assault.  In ''Vädersolstavlan'', the inner tower (''Inre Söderport'') is similar to the exterior tower, and both structures, together with the narrow bridge between them, match other historical sources. Additions younger than the 1530s, such as the reinforcements ordered by Gustav Vasa during the 1540s, are missing in the painting but present in engravings from 1560 to 1580, which confirms ''Vädersolstavlan'' is a credible contemporary document.&lt;ref name=&quot;St-Erik-Weidhagen-Hallerdt-33-34&quot;&gt;Weidhagen-Hallerdt, ''St Eriks årsbok 1999'', pp 33-34&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the southern city gates were, is today the [[Slussen]] area.  The [[sluice]] and the [[Lock (water transport)|locks]] of [[Karl Johanslussen]] had to be rebuilt regularly, and the appearance of the city's southern approach changed constantly.  In the early 1930s, when a multi-story concrete roundabout replaced everything else in the area, the foundations of the outer defensive tower were discovered&lt;ref name=&quot;Lorentzi-Olgarsson&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Slussen - 1935 års anläggning | language = Swedish | pages = 28 | author1 = Mari Lorentzi | author2 = Per Olgarsson | year = 2005 | publisher = [[Stockholm City Museum]] | location = Stockholm | accessdate = 2008-06-02 | isbn = 91-85233-37-4 | url = http://www.stockholmskallan.se/php/fupload/SMF/BI_Slussen_del_1.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927204805/http://www.stockholmskallan.se/php/fupload/SMF/BI_Slussen_del_1.pdf | archivedate = 2007-09-27 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; (known as ''Gustav Vasas rondell'') and remains of the southern defensive structures can still be found below the present squares in the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Söderlund-2004&quot;&gt;Söderlund, ''St Eriks årsbok 2004'', pp 11-21&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Defensive structures ===
[[File:Gamla stan västra stranden Vädersolstavlan.JPG|thumb|center|600px|Western shoreline of the medieval city]]
[[File:Kornhamnstorg Gamla stan jonez flickr.jpg|thumb|Present façades facing [[Kornhamnstorg]] with the spire of the [[German Church, Stockholm|German Church]] in the background]]
Along the western shoreline are several defensive structures of various ages. The wooden defence structure built along the shore around 1650 is absent in the painting, but the double row of piles protecting the western harbour is present.  It served both as a defensive structure and, because a duty was imposed on all incoming ships, as an important source of income for the city. The western defence structures were neglected around 1500, which resulted in settlements being constructed between the western city wall and a shoreline constantly pushed westward by landfill, just as the painting renders it.&lt;ref name=&quot;St-Erik-Weidhagen-Hallerdt-34-36&quot;&gt;Weidhagen-Hallerdt, ''St Eriks årsbok 1999'', pp 34-36&lt;/ref&gt;

While the old city wall is not discernible in the painting, several of the towers sitting on the city gates are (left to right):&lt;ref name=&quot;St-Erik-Weidhagen-Hallerdt-34-36&quot; /&gt;
# The tower with a cone-shaped roof just to the right of the Greyfriars monastery was called ''Draktornet'' (&quot;Dragon's Tower&quot;), and in 1535 served as a prison.
# Just to the right of it was ''Gråmunketornet'' (&quot;Greyfriars Tower&quot;) with stepped gables and a large gate leading to Riddarholmen island. Excavations in the 1950 showed that the gate was 1.5&amp;nbsp;metres (5&amp;nbsp;feet) wide.
# The second tower with stepped gables but without a gate was the ''Lejontornet'' (&quot;Lion's Tower&quot;), the foundations of which were rediscovered during an archaeological excavation in 1984 and are now part of the interior of a restaurant on [[Yxsmedsgränd]].
# Between ''Lejontornet'' and the southern city gate flanked by two boats is a wooden structure, roughly triangular in plan; this is a defensive tower called ''Kivenäbben'', built in 1520–1523 on piles in the water.

Lastly, next to the southern city gate is an open space, believed to be the precursor of present-day [[Kornhamnstorg]], the square where ships from the [[Mälaren|Lake Mälaren]] region used to deliver corn and iron.&lt;ref name=&quot;St-Erik-Weidhagen-Hallerdt-31-32&quot;&gt;Weidhagen-Hallerdt, ''St Eriks årsbok 1999'', pp 31-32&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other buildings and surrounding ridges ===
[[File:Järntorget Våghuset Svartbrödraklotret Vädersolstavlan.JPG|thumb|250px|Southern part of Gamla stan including [[Södra Bankohuset]] (with stepped gables), [[Järntorget (Stockholm)|Järntorget]], (in front of the former) and the Blackfriars monastery (with a tall turret).  Also note the mast indicating the location of the &quot;Cog Harbour&quot;.]]
The turret on the right side of the church and the palace was the [[Blackfriar]]s monastery, inaugurated in 1343 and demolished in 1547.  It was built on the location of the first southern defensive tower, of which no traces have been found. The basement of the monastery, however, can still be seen by [[Benickebrinken]] and the school next to [[Tyska Stallplan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;St-Erik-Weidhagen-Hallerdt-27-28&quot; /&gt;

During the Middle Ages, there were two harbours west and east of the city's southern square; in the painting they are only suggested by the presence of a mast behind the city. On the western shore at ''Kornhamn'' (&quot;Grain Harbour&quot;) &amp;ndash; today [[Kornhamnstorg]] &amp;ndash; grain, iron, and other goods from the [[Mälaren|Lake Mälaren]] area were delivered. These goods were then weighed in the ''Våghuset'' (&quot;The Scales Building&quot;, i.e. a [[weigh house]]), another important source of income for both the crown and the city, before being transported to the eastern harbour, ''Kogghamnen'' (&quot;The [[Cog (ship)|Cog]] Harbour&quot;) &amp;ndash; today the southern part of [[Skeppsbron]] &amp;ndash; from which large ships delivered goods across the [[Baltic Sea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lindgren-25&quot;&gt;Lindgren, ''Burspråk, Kåken, Sankt Göran och draken'', p 25&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Suecia 1-054 ; Sodra Bancohuset.jpg|thumb|left|The Baroque version of [[Södra Bankohuset]] as depicted in ''[[Suecia Antiqua et Hodierna]]'' around 1700]]
In the painting, the ''Våghuset'' is the building with stepped gables and iron bars to the right of the Blackfriars monastery facing [[Järntorget (Stockholm)|Järntorget]] (&quot;Iron Square&quot;). ''Våghuset'' was located where the [[Södra Bankohuset]] (&quot;Southern [National] Bank Building&quot;) is today. Just behind ''Våghuset'' there is another stepped gable symbolizing the ''Klädeshuset'' (&quot;Broadcloth Building&quot;) where goods were stored. The building with stepped gables between the church and the Blackfriars monastery was ''Själagården'' (&quot;Soul's Homestead&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;St-Erik-Weidhagen-Hallerdt-29-30&quot;&gt;Weidhagen-Hallerdt, ''St Eriks årsbok 1999'', pp 29-30&lt;/ref&gt; It was built in the 15th century at [[Själagårdsgatan]] to accommodate the poor and aged but also priests and others serving at the church. During the reign of Gustav Vasa it was transformed into the first royal printing house.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lindgren-25&quot; /&gt;

Between the city and the horizon are several rural islands, which today form part of central Stockholm. Behind the church and the castle is [[Skeppsholmen]], which for centuries served as a base for the [[Swedish Navy]] together with [[Kastellholmen]] islet, which can be seen above the Blackfriars monastery. To the left of Skeppsholmen are two small islets, which are today merged into the peninsula of [[Blasieholmen]]. Behind these islands are [[Djurgården]] (right), [[Östermalm]], and [[Norra Djurgården]] (left). On the horizon, the [[Lilla Värtan]] strait passes in front of [[Lidingö]] and, arguably, the interior islands of the [[Stockholm archipelago]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GS750-Weidhagen-historik&quot; /&gt;

Like the islands, the ridges surrounding the city, including the cliffs in the foreground, look very much as they still do. South (right) of the city is the island of [[Södermalm]], where a cluster of buildings (see image of the southern city gate above) lined up along the shore called ''Tranbodarna'' were used to burn [[train oil]] (e.g. seal lard).  The round building on the eastern end of Södermalm was the gallows hill.  As depicted in the painting, it was used exclusively for men (women were beheaded).  The gallows remained there until the late 17th century when they were moved to present-day [[Hammarbyhöjden]] south of the historical city centre.&lt;ref name=&quot;St-Erik-Weidhagen-Hallerdt-31-32&quot; /&gt;

Sun at bottom centre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;Produced by Les Cowley using [http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/halfeat.htm HaloSim].&lt;/small&gt;]]

While the painting is arguably the oldest realistic depiction of a [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|halo phenomenon]] —&amp;nbsp;almost a century older than [[Christoph Scheiner]]'s famous observation of a halo display over Rome in 1630&lt;ref name=&quot;St-Erik-2007-Hallquist&quot;&gt;Malmquist, pp 31–41&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;— the phenomenon was apparently not entirely understood. The image contains several obvious misinterpretations and a few peculiarities.  Most notably, like many other early depictions of haloes,&lt;ref name=&quot;atopics-Lowitz&quot;&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/lowpete.htm
 | title = The 1790 St Petersburg Display | author = Cowley, Les

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the painting depicts a series of events occurring over several hours and is consistent in its preference for perfect circles rather than ellipses.

[[File:Cirrus fibratus and Cirrus uncinus behind Stratocumulus over Warsaw, June 26, 2005.jpg|thumb|left|120px|[[Cirrus fibratus]] (center) and [[Cirrus uncinus]] (bottom)]]
A work of art produced in the spirit of the Danube School&lt;ref name=&quot;St-Erik-Svanberg-86&quot;&gt;Svanberg, p 86&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[#Possible prototypes|Possible prototypes]] above), ''Vädersolstavlan'' features realistic depictions of [[cirrus cloud]]s and the sky is properly rendered, going from bright blue near the [[horizon]] to dark blue near [[zenith]]. The shadows in the lower half of the painting, however, seem to suggest the sun is located in the west — even leaving the southern façades in shadow — which is incorrect as historical sources claim the event lasted from 7 to 9 a.m.&lt;ref name=&quot;St-Erik-Weidhagen-Hallerdt-20&quot;&gt;Weidhagen-Hallerdt, ''St Eriks årsbok 1999'', p 20&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to the city below it, the halo phenomenon is depicted vertically in a [[fisheye lens|fisheye]] perspective with the major circle centred on [[zenith]] (like in the ray tracing solution above).&lt;ref name=&quot;St-Erik-Svanberg-65&quot;&gt;Svanberg, p 65&lt;/ref&gt;

In the painting, the actual sun is the yellow ball in the upper-right corner surrounded by the second circle.  The large circle taking up most of the sky is a '''[[parhelic circle]]''', parallel to the horizon and located at the same altitude as the sun, as the painting renders it.  This is actually a common halo, although a full circle as depicted is rare.  Such parhelic circles are caused by horizontally oriented plate ice crystals reflecting sun rays.  In order for a full circle to appear sun rays must be reflected both internally and externally.&lt;ref name=&quot;atoptics-parhelic&quot;&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/parcirc.htm

 | title = Parhlic Circle Formation
 | author = Cowley, Les | publisher = Atmospheric Optics
 | accessdate = 2007-04-23
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The circle surrounding the sun is a '''[[22° halo]]''', as the name implies located 22° from the sun.  While the painting depict it pretty much as it normally appears, it should be centred on the sun and is misplaced in the painting.&lt;ref name=&quot;atoptics-22-degree&quot;&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/circular.htm
 | title = 22° Circular Halo | author = Cowley, Les
 | publisher = Atmospheric Optics | accessdate = 2007-04-23
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The pair of arcs flanking the 22° halo and crossing each other are most likely a misinterpretation of a '''[[circumscribed halo]]'''.  While the sun is still low, it starts as a V-shaped [[upper tangent arc]] which gradually develops into something looking like the unfolding wings of a seagull. As the sun ascends, in rare cases it finally joins with the [[lower tangent arc]] to form an ellipse which closes in on the circumscribed 22° halo.&lt;ref name=&quot;atoptics-tangent-arcs&quot;&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/column.htm atopics.co.uk
 | title = Tangent Arcs | author = Cowley, Les
 | accessdate = 2007-04-23 | publisher = Atmospheric Optics
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[sun dog]]s''' or '''parhelia''', in the painting erroneously pinned to the misinterpreted arcs of the circumscribed halo, are rather frequent optical phenomena which appear when sunlight is [[refraction|refracted]] by [[hexagon]]al [[ice crystal]]s forming [[cirrus cloud|cirrus]] or [[cirrostratus cloud]]s.  When the sun is still low, they are located ''on'' the 22° halo, the way they are most commonly observed, and as the sun ascends they move laterally away from the 22° halo.&lt;ref name=&quot;atopics-circum&quot;&gt;{{cite web

 | title = Circumscribed Halo - 43° high sun
 | publisher = Atmospheric Optics | author = Cowley, Les
 | accessdate = 2008-02-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At rare occasions, they can actually reach the circumscribed halo.  As depicted in the painting, the sun dogs are located midway between the 22° halo and the circumscribed halo, and, assuming they are correctly rendered, the sun should have been located at about 35-40° above the horizon (as in the simulation above).&lt;ref name=&quot;weather-dr&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!---
Another, but very unlikely, possibility is that the arcs represent a [[supralateral arc]] in combination with a upper tangent arc. (They are typically located far from each other.)
----&gt;

The unintelligible arc on the lower right might be a misinterpreted and misplaced '''[[infralateral arc]]''' missing its mirrored twin.  These phenomena are, however, rare and only form when the sun is below 32°. Their shape change quickly as the sun rises, and as the painting most likely isn't depicting any specific moment, it is impossible to draw any conclusions from the mysterious shape in the painting.&lt;ref name=&quot;atoptics-circumscribed&quot;&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Anthelion 120 parhelion Vädersolstavlan.jpg|thumb|134px|A 120° parhelion (top) and the [[anthelion]] (bottom) from the painting]]
[[File:120parhelion.jpg|thumb|left|A [[120° parhelion]]]]
The crescent moon shape in the middle of the sky looks very much like a '''[[circumzenithal arc]]''', which is parallel to the horizon but centred at and located near [[zenith]].  However, they only form when the sun is located ''lower'' than 32.2° and are at their brightest when the sun is located at 22°, which is not consistent with other haloes depicted in the painting.  Furthermore, one of the most striking features of circumzenithal arcs is their rainbow colours, and the shape in the painting is perfectly devoid of any colours. It is however not a complete circle (see [[Kern arc]]), and it is facing the sun, which are both correct properties for this phenomenon.&lt;ref name=&quot;atoptics-circumzen&quot;&gt;{{cite web 
 | url = http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/cza.htm atoptics.co.uk
 | title = Circumzenithal Arc | author = Cowley, Les
 | publisher = Atmospheric Optics | accessdate = 2007-04-23
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The white spot on the lower left part of the parhelic circle, opposite to the sun, should be an '''[[anthelion]]''', a bright halo always located at the [[antisolar point]].  Most scientists are convinced anthelia are caused by the convergence of several halo arcs (of which are no traces in the painting) and thus should not be regarded as an independent halo.  Other researchers believe column-shaped crystals could generate the phenomenon which could explain the constellation in the painting.&lt;ref name=&quot;meteoros-anthelion&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Finally, the minor, slightly bluish dots, flanking the anthelion, may be perfectly depicted '''[[120° parhelion|120° parhelia]]'''. These halos are produced by the same horizontally oriented ice crystals that produce sun dogs and the parhelic circle.  They result from multiple interior reflections of sun rays entering the hexagonal top face and leaving through the bottom face.&lt;ref name=&quot;atoptics-120-parhelion&quot;&gt;{{cite web

'''''Snow at Argenteuil'''''  ({{lang-fr|Rue sous la neige, Argenteuil}}) is an oil-on-canvas [[Landscape art|landscape painting]] from the [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] artist [[Claude Monet]]. It is the largest of no fewer than eighteen works Monet painted of his home commune of [[Argenteuil]]  while it was under a blanket of snow during the winter of 1874–1875. This painting—number&amp;nbsp;352 in Wildenstein’s catalogue of the works of Monet—is the largest of the eighteen. The attention to detail evident in the smaller paintings is less evident in this larger picture. Instead, Monet has rendered large areas of the canvas in closely like tones and colours of blue and grey. The application of smaller strokes of greens, yellows, reds and darker blues breaks up these large expanses, and the almost choreographed dispersal of these various colours helps bind the picture together. Paint at the depicted road surface is thicker than elsewhere in the painting, and impasto is suggestive of the feel of disturbed snow.&lt;ref&gt;The Simon Sainsbury Bequest to Tate and The National Gallery. Edited by Andrew Wilson. Tate Publishing, a division of Tate Enterprises Ltd., Millbank, London SW1P&amp;nbsp;4RG. 2008. {{ISBN|978-1-85437-790-6}}. Page&amp;nbsp;48,&amp;nbsp;49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of Monet’s ''Snow at Argenteuil'' pictures from the winter of 1874–1875 were painted from locations close to the house on the boulevard&amp;nbsp;Saint-Denis (now number 21&amp;nbsp;boulevard&amp;nbsp;Karl Marx) into which Monet and his family had just moved. This particular painting shows the boulevard Saint-Denis looking in the direction of the junction with the rue&amp;nbsp;de&amp;nbsp;la&amp;nbsp;Voie-des-Bans, with the river Seine out of sight to the rear, and the local railway station behind Monet’s back as he painted.&lt;ref&gt;The National Gallery Review of the Year.

In December 1879 the painting was acquired from Monet by Théodore Duret. Recalling a conversation with the artist [[Édouard&amp;nbsp;Manet]], Duret years later reported that, ‘One winter he [''Manet''] wanted to paint a snow scene. I had in my possession just such a piece from Monet. After seeing it, he said “It is perfect! I would not know how to do better”, whereupon he gave up painting snow.’{{Cref2|A}}&lt;ref&gt;Histoire de Édouard Manet et&amp;nbsp;de&amp;nbsp;son œuvre. Théodore Duret.

Acquavella Galleries of New York acquired the painting in the early 1970s, and then it was purchased by [[Simon Sainsbury]] in or around 1973.

[[File:Paul Cézanne 146.jpg|400px|thumb|[[Paul Cézanne]], ''L'Estaque, Melting Snow'', c. 1871, 28.75 cm × 36.25 cm. Private collection.]]

'''''L'Estaque, Melting Snow''''' is a c. 1871 oil-on-canvas painting by French [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]] artist [[Paul Cézanne]]. It shows a view from the outskirts of [[L'Estaque]], a small village near [[Marseille]], with a steep hillside covered in a  drift of melting snow underneath a foreboding dark grey sky.&lt;ref&gt;Athanassoglou-Kallmyer, 111&lt;/ref&gt; Filled with intense emotion, the painting has been described as similar to the work of [[Vincent van Gogh]] the following decade, and a painting more formally similar to early 20th-century than contemporaneous art.&lt;ref name=&quot;S54&quot;&gt;Schapiro, 54&lt;/ref&gt; ''L'Estaque, Melting Snow'' was painted in a single session.&lt;ref name=&quot;A63&quot;/&gt; It is one of only two snow-laden winter subjects Cézanne painted.&lt;ref name=&quot;A63&quot;/&gt;

Cézanne moved to [[Provence]] in 1870 to evade military service during the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. He soon moved to L'Estaque, where he painted a number of landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;Athanassoglou-Kallmyer, 216&lt;/ref&gt; Critics differ in their interpretation of this painting, some see it as wholly personal, other as a response to the war with Prussia. Supporting the latter view, [[Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka]] saw the painting as making a statement on social and political transformation and wrote of the political context in which it was created, &quot;what is our response to those red-roofed houses which are held, as if in a vice, between a leaden sky and a sliding block of snow?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tymieniecka, 148&lt;/ref&gt;

The colors are oppressively dark, while the thickly painted, quick brushwork adds to the urgent violence of the scene. With the exception of the red rooftops and the greens of the trees in the foreground, the colors and the tones are monotonous and gloomy. The whites, greys and blacks are used mostly for emotional impact.&lt;ref name=&quot;S54&quot;/&gt; Though ''L'Estaque, Melting Snow'' evidences Cézanne's new-found facility in depicting the deep space of a landscape, it is marked by an emotional intensity closer in spirit to the turbulence of his early figure works than to the structural complexity of the later landscape paintings.&lt;ref name=&quot;A63&quot;&gt;Adriani, 63&lt;/ref&gt;

The diagonal of the hill cuts across the painting from left to right, dividing avalanche on one side and gloom on the other. The hill sweeps down until it rests just above the red roof of a barely visible house at its foot—an effect that art critic [[Meyer Schapiro]] described as giving &quot;a rushing force to the image.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;S54&quot; /&gt; The dark brown trees on the slope's ledge have twisted trunks and rest on unsteady ground, while the trees in the mid-ground are painted in black and form a descending arch which moves inwards towards the center of the canvas before merging with the ominous overhanging clouds. Given the angle of the hill and the depth from which the houses are viewed, it is difficult to imagine where the observer is supposed to be positioned. 

Writer Ronald Berman drew comparison between Cézanne's treatment of this landscape and the way [[Ernest Hemingway]] imbues the Irati River in [[Navarre]] with emotional scope in his 1926 novel on the [[lost generation]], ''[[The Sun Also Rises]]''. In both, the landscape is subjective and the viewpoint of the observer is paramount—the landscape is representational and perceived differently by each character. According to Berman, &quot;The foreground is the observer's space&quot;. In the Cézanne, nature becomes an extension of the observer's mental landscape, and in Hemingway it is a representation of each viewer's need for inclusion within the natural order.&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Ronald. &quot;Translating Modernism: Fitzgerald and Hemingway&quot;.

'''''Niagara Falls, from the American Side''''' is a [[painting]] by the American artist [[Frederic Edwin Church]] (1826–1900). Completed in 1867, and based on preliminary sketches made by the artist at [[Niagara Falls]] and on a sepia photograph, it is the third of a series of paintings Church made of this famous landmark. The painting is now in the collection of the [[Scottish National Gallery]].&lt;ref name=natgall&gt;{{cite web|title=Niagara Falls, from the American side|url=https://www.nationalgalleries.org/collection/artists-a-z/c/artist/frederic-edwin-church/object/niagara-falls-from-the-american-side-ng-799|website=nationalgalleries.org|publisher=National Galleries Scotland|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Church was a leading member of the [[Hudson River School]] of painters.&lt;ref name=craven&gt;{{cite book|last1=Craven|first1=Wayne|title=American art: history and culture|date=2003|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=0071415246|pages=207–209|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting depicts the view from the east side of Niagara Falls&amp;nbsp;– the American side. In the spray of the waterfall a rainbow is visible.

==History==
[[File:Niagara by Frederic Edwin Church, 1857 - Corcoran Gallery of Art - DSC01135.JPG|thumb|left|''Niagara'', 1857. Oil on canvas, 102 × 230 cm. [[Corcoran Gallery of Art|Corcoran collection]],  [[National Gallery of Art|National Gallery of Art, Washington]]]]
Church made his first painting of the falls in 1857. He had visited the falls several times in July and late August the previous year, making a number of pencil and oil [[Sketch (drawing)|sketches]] from different points of view. He elected to paint the scene from the Canadian side, choosing unconventional dimensions for the painting that emphasized the panoramic effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;NGA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Niagara|url=http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.166436.html|publisher=[[National Gallery of Art]]|accessdate=November 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was an immediate success, attracting over 100,000 visitors within the first fortnight of its premiere at a New York gallery. Following this, it was exhibited at major cities on the Eastern seaboard, toured Britain twice and was selected for the [[International Exposition (1867)|1867 Exposition Universelle]] in Paris. It was purchased by the recently founded [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]] in 1876, cementing that institution's success. When the Corcoran closed in 2014, its collection was gifted to the  [[National Gallery of Art|National Gallery of Art, Washington]], where the painting can be seen today in the Corcoran gallery.&lt;ref name=&quot;NGA&quot;/&gt;

The painting ''Niagara Falls, from the American Side'' was commissioned from Church by the American [[art dealer]] Michael Knoedler in 1866. It was the third painting of the series and may have been originally destined for the Exposition. The painting was purchased by [[John S. Kennedy]] in 1887, who gifted it to his homeland of Scotland.&lt;ref name=natgall/&gt; ''Niagara Falls, from the American Side'' is the only major work by Frederic Edwin Church which is in a public collection in Europe.&lt;ref name=natgall/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aladinrc.wrlc.org/bitstream/handle/1961/14815/Holmstead_american_0008N_10433display.pdf?sequence=1|title=Neither land nor water:Martin Jonson Heade, Frederic Edwin Church and American landscape painting in the nineteenth century |pp=23–26, 36–38, 40 |publisher=WRLC|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
[[File:Study for &quot;Under Niagara&quot; Frederic Edwin Church.jpg|thumbnail|One of the studies of the Niagara falls]]
The canvas is painted in the [[Romantic style]] and captures the aesthetic principles of the sublime and the ''[[picturesque]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csmt.uchicago.edu/glossary2004/beautifulsublime.htm|title=The University of Chicago: beautiful, sublime|publisher=csmt.uchicago.edu|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Church was a member of the [[Hudson River School]], a group of [[landscape painting|landscape]] artists, whose aesthetic vision was influenced by romanticism. The Romantic movement validated intense emotions. The movement was placing new emphasis on the sentiments of visionary and transcendental experience. Emotions like [[Awe (emotion)|awe]]&amp;nbsp;– especially that which is experienced in confronting the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublimity]] of untamed nature and its picturesque qualities&amp;nbsp;– were now entirely new aesthetic categories, and very different from art styles of the same era&amp;nbsp;– the unemotional [[Realism (art movement)|Realism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/rlsm/hd_rlsm.htm |title=Metropolitan Museum of Art|publisher=www.metmuseum.org|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of the calm, balanced [[Classicism]]&lt;ref&gt;[Neoclassicism]&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– as a source of [[aesthetic]] experience.&lt;ref name=Tate&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.tate.org.uk/download/file/fid/6378|title=American Sublime |publisher=www.tate.org.uk|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/roma/hd_roma.htm|title=Romanticism|publisher=www.metmuseum.org|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sublime (philosophy)|Sublime]] view of nature was as something of a large scale dramatic subject, an expression of the sublime&amp;nbsp;– defined by [[Edmund Burke]] as the strongest emotion that can be felt.&lt;ref name=tate&gt;{{cite web|title=American Sublime: Landscape Painting in the United States 1820–1880 (exhibition in 2002)|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/about/press-office/press-releases/american-sublime-landscape-painting-united-states-1820-1880|website=tate.org.uk|publisher=Tate Press Office|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{cite web|title=Encyclopædia Britannica article on Romanticism|url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/508675/Romanticism|website=britannica.com|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=burke&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burke|first1=Edmund|title=On the Sublime and Beautiful|url=http://www.bartleby.com/24/2/107.html|website=bartleby.com|publisher=Bartleby|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cairn in Snow''''' ({{lang-de|'''Hünengrab im Schnee'''}}) is a [[landscape painting]] by [[Caspar David Friedrich]]. It was created in 1807. The painting is a [[Romantic period|Romantic]] [[allegory|allegorical]] landscape, showing what appears to be a [[Neolithic]] burial site among three oaks, near the town [[Gützkow]] in Germany. The painter depicts barren trees in the snow, giving the work a haunted, spectral air. With its contemplative melancholy mood, the painting transmits a Romantic view of nature. 

Trees and forests were seen as symbols of life endurance, longevity, and immortality. [[Sacred groves]], often a group of trees in ancient times, were associated with secrecy and initiation rites, and they were regarded as untouchable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/y9882e/y9882e08.htm|title=Forest and tree symbolism in folklore |publisher=www.fao.org|accessdate=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/648638/world-tree|title=World tree|publisher= global.britannica.com|accessdate=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The main trees depicted in this painting by Friedrich appear to have had most of their old branches chopped off.

Today the painting is in the [[Galerie Neue Meister]] in [[Dresden]]. Originally, it was owned by the [[Greifswald University]] professor Karl Schildener. The painting is described in 1828 in the ''Greifswald academical journal'' (II, 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;40&amp;ndash;41).&lt;ref&gt;[http://skd-online-collection.skd.museum/de/contents/showArtist?id=241955 &quot;Hünengrab im Schnee&quot;], Staatliche Kunstsammlung Dresden.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chris Noir, [http://timedoesnotrest.wordpress.com/2013/04/29/caspar-david-friedrich/ &quot;Caspar David Friedrich&quot;], Time Does Not Rest, 29 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Friedrich is  noted for his landscapes depicting features silhouetted against the sky, morning mists, or Gothic ruins. This work is one of his earliest oil paintings.

'''''View from Stalheim''''' ({{lang-no|'''Fra Stalheim'''}}) is an 1842 [[oil painting]] by [[J. C. Dahl]] of the mountainous view from [[Stalheim]], [[Voss]], [[Hordaland]]. It is a major work of Romantic nationalism and has become a national icon. It is regarded as one of Dahl's best works.

'''''Wivenhoe Park''''' is a painting of an [[English landscape park]], the estate of the Rebow family, by the English Romantic painter, [[John Constable]] (1776–1837).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dcist.com/2010/03/permanent_collection_john_constable.php|title=permanent_collection_john_constable|publisher=dcist.com|access-date=22 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150507214945/http://dcist.com/2010/03/permanent_collection_john_constable.php|archivedate=7 May 2015|df=}} Re-Retrieved 12 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[''“No two days are alike, nor even two hours; neither was there ever two leaves of tree alike since the creation of the world.” So said John Constable (1776–1837), regarded by many as England’s greatest landscape painter. His work Wivenhoe Park, Essex (1816) at the National Gallery of Art vibrates with the verdant essence of the countryside. Constable’s studies, sketchbooks and paintings all reveal the profound connection he felt to the landscapes of his native Suffolk and the surrounding counties.'' Quote from Aleid Ford's project, Art 2010, for DCist online magazine for the Washington DC USA area. Ford is a staff member of DCist.]&lt;/ref&gt;

John Constable was born in Suffolk, and is known principally for his landscape paintings, especially the landscapes of the countryside where he spent his childhood. His paintings are now considered among the most popular and valuable in British art.&lt;ref name=NGA&gt;{{cite web|last1=Collection Highlights|title=Wivenhoe Park, Essex|url=http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/highlights/highlight1147.html|website=nga.gov|publisher=National Gallery of Art|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[''Major-General Rebow, a friend of Constable’s father, commissioned the artist to capture the beauty of his estate, inviting him to spend some weeks on the premises. General Rebow specified that certain features be included in the painting. Constable arranged these harmoniously, modifying the actual location of certain elements (for example, the house and lake were not actually part of the same view). Typically, the owner of such a house might wish for a more grandiose portrait of it, but Constable preferred the everyday poetry of landscape and sky.''Quote from Aleid Ford's project, Art 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==
[[The National Gallery of Art]] holds this painting as one of its highlights:&lt;ref name=NGA /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;A pleasant sense of ease and harmony pervades this landscape of almost photographic clarity. The large areas of brilliant sunshine and cool shade, the rambling line of the fence, and the beautiful balance of trees, meadow, and river are evidence of the artist's creative synthesis of the actual site.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The painting was commissioned by the owner of [[Wivenhoe Park]], Major General Francis Slater-Rebow, who was among the artist's first patrons, being a close friend of the artist's father, Golding Constable. Wivenhoe Park is {{convert|200|acres|ha}} of parkland, purchased by the Rebow family before 1734.&lt;ref name=marsden&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marsden|first1=Pat|title=Wivenhoe House: A Tale of Two Lost 18th Century Mansions and the Sea-Captains who Built Them|url=http://www.wivencyclopedia.org/History/Wivenhoe%20House%20for%20blog%2022%2005%2012.pdf|website=Wivenhoe Encyclopedia|publisher=Eugene Kraft|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=col_uni&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to Colchester Campus|url=http://www.essex.ac.uk/about/campuses/colchester/|website=essex.ac.uk|publisher=Essex University|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slater-Rebow commissioned several paintings from Constable, including a portrait of the general's seven-year-old daughter in 1812. She also figures in this painting, in a donkey cart to the left. This painting, finished in September 1816, earned the artist enough money to allow him to marry his long-time love, Mary Bicknell. They married in October 1816.&lt;ref name=NGA /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[''The painting was a important project for Constable on a personal level: He needed the income the commission generated in order to provide for his longtime love, Maria Bicknell, and enable them to marry with the approval of her parents, who opposed the match for a number of years. ''Wivenhoe Park, Essex'' was finished by September 1816, and Bicknell and Constable were at last married on October 2, 1816.'' Quote from Aleid Ford's project, Art 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Constable's art is always penetrated by longing, melancholy and a yearning for the simple, natural life, for a [[bucolic]], [[pastoral]] idyll,  to [[rural]] subjects and aspects of life in the countryside, a &quot;golden age&quot; when people lived together in harmony with nature, a world on its way of disappearing when he painted his landscapes thanks to the beginning of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. He was aware of the issue of [[Urban area|urban]] growth, of urban life's  unpleasantness-  which he contrasted to life in the [[countryside]]. Constable's art was rather unconventional for his time, and he loved simple things, a natural landscape without the ruins, dramatic effects or exalted, often excessive feelings, like the ones displayed in the paintings of his contemporary, [[J. M. W. Turner]]. His landscapes are flooded by a silvery brilliant light in the water and air and in the sky - and are characterised  by a special intensity that is such an important feature of this artist's works.{{sfnp|Beckett|1994|p=268|ps=}}

'''''Dancing Fairies''''' ({{lang-sv|Älvalek}}) is a painting by the Swedish painter [[August Malmström]] (1829–1901).  The painting depicts [[fairies]] dancing above the water, in a moonlit landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/dancing-fairies/vwEzlg8fF50zZg |title=Dancing Fairies |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=30 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==
The fairies dancing in the meadow in the twilight flow over the [[Landscape painting|romantic landscape]]; one of them bends over the water to catch a glimpse of her own image.  This visionary painting depicts the morning mist turning into fairies, like the spirits of untamed nature. Fairies were seen as delicate,  tender, sensitive but also capricious and inclined to have their feelings hurt easily and take offence if not treated well. In the Swedish [[folk tradition]], people were warned to watch out for elves, as they could be dangerous for those who were not careful with them.   The fairies in Norse mythology's [[Scandinavian folklore|hidden people]] have survived in local folklore often as beautiful young women, living in the wild on hills, woods and mounds of stones. In [[Romanticism|Romantic]] art and literature, elves are typically pictured as fair-haired, white-clad, and nasty when offended.&lt;!-- emotions like   its picturesque qualities  experience --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalmuseum.se/Global/PDF/Skolan/Nationella%20provet%20VT08/PDF_skola_NP_VT08_FAKTA_Alvalek.pdf |title=Älvalek |publisher=[[Nationalmuseum]] |accessdate=30 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalmuseum.se/Global/PDF/Skolan/arbetsmaterial_skolor_utomlands/folktales.pdf|title=Global-folktales|publisher=www.nationalmuseum.se|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1137376856|title=The History of the Kiss: The Birth of Popular Culture|publisher=books.google.se}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to protect themselves and their [[livestock]] against malevolent elves, Scandinavians could use an ''Älvkors'' (Elf cross), which was carved into buildings or other objects.&lt;ref name=&quot;alvkors&quot;&gt;The article ''[http://runeberg.org/nfba/0313.html Alfkors]'' in ''[[Nordisk familjebok]]'' (1904).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painter==
August Malmström's ''Dancing Fairies'' is a widely recognised work in its home country.  Malmström, who was a professor at the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Arts]], was one of the Swedish artists who aspired to create a [[Romantic nationalism|national]] [[Swedish art]]. He used themes both from [[Norse mythology]] and folklore, and his images often depicted fairies and other spirits of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://runeberg.org/nfbq/0352.html |title=Malmström |publisher= runeberg.org|accessdate=30 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Skaters in the Bois de Boulogne''''' ({{lang-fr|Les patineurs à Longchamp}}) is an oil-on-canvas landscape painting by the French artist [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], created during the winter of 1868. The painting depicts a snowscape with a large number of Parisians, young and old, spending leisure time on a frozen park lake. Due to Renoir's strong dislike of cold temperatures and snow, the piece is one of his few [[Winter landscapes in Western art|winter landscape]]s.

==Background==
[[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] (1841–1919) first met landscape painters [[Alfred Sisley]] (1839–1899), [[Claude Monet]] (1840–1926), and figure painter [[Frédéric Bazille]] (1841–1870) at the [[Atelier|art studio]] of Swiss artist [[Charles Gleyre]] in 1861.  In addition to their friendship, all would prove influential in Renoir's work. For the next several years, Renoir attended the [[École des Beaux-Arts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;moffett&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;vollard&quot;/&gt;  He first exhibited a large painting at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] in 1863, but destroyed his work. That same year, Renoir was living in a studio with Bazille who introduced him to [[Paul Cézanne]] (1839–1906) and [[Camille Pissarro]] (1830–1903).

An early painting, ''The Cabaret of Mère Anthony'' (1866), represents for Renoir &quot;some of the most agreeable memories&quot; of his life with friends at a village inn during this time.  He soon moved to the village of Chailly near [[Bourron-Marlotte|Marlotte]] and the [[forest of Fontainebleau]], and began working with model [[Lise Tréhot]] who posed for him between 1866 and 1872. Renoir began painting at La Grenouillère, a popular middle class day resort with a floating dance hall, in late 1868.&lt;ref name=&quot;moffett&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;vollard&quot;&gt;Vollard, Ambroise (1925). ''Renoir: An Intimate Record''.  Courier Corporation. pp. 9–20. {{ISBN|978-0-486-26488-2}}. {{oclc|23082906}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Like Monet and several other Impressionists, Renoir worked ''[[en plein air]]'', painting outdoors, but unlike Monet, who was known for painting in the cold and snow, Renoir was not fond of cold temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;Karlins, N. F. (July 7, 1999). &quot;[http://www.artnet.com/magazine_pre2000/features/karlins/karlins7-7-99.asp Winter in New York]&quot;.  ''Artnet''. Retrieved March 31, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  Years later, he told art dealer [[Ambroise Vollard]] that he could not stand the cold: &quot;But then, even if you can stand the cold, why paint snow?  It is a blight on the face of Nature.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;vollard&quot;/&gt; Although it is unknown when his symptoms began, Renoir was known to suffer from [[rheumatoid arthritis]] from at least 1892 onward, an affliction which would severely restrict his artistic production in late life.&lt;ref name=BMJ&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/315/7123/1704|title=How Renoir coped with rheumatoid arthritis|work=BMJ|accessdate=November 23, 2015|date=December 20, 1997|first=Annelies|last=Boonen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description== 
Renoir, who was then 26 years old, painted ''Skaters in the Bois de Boulogne'' in the public park of [[Bois de Boulogne]] in Paris ''en plein air'' during the cold winter month of January 1868.&lt;ref name=&quot;sweeney&quot;/&gt;  Newspaper accounts of the time recorded freezing temperatures allowing people to walk across the [[Seine]] and ice skate on rivers and streams.&lt;ref name=&quot;moffett&quot;/&gt;  Due to Renoir's dislike of cold temperatures, it is one of the few winter landscapes he completed aside from a few minor studies.&lt;ref name=&quot;aic&quot;&gt;Groom, Gloria. Jill Shaw (ed). (2014). &quot;[https://publications.artic.edu/renoir/reader/paintingsanddrawings#section/135636 Cat. 8 Seascape, 1879: Curatorial Entry]&quot;. ''Renoir Paintings and Drawings at the Art Institute of Chicago''. Art Institute of Chicago. Paragraph 2, Footnote 2. {{ISBN|978-0-86559-270-4}}. {{oclc|886893978}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the painting, the park itself was relatively new, with construction beginning in 1852 under a public works program led by [[Georges-Eugène Haussmann]] under the direction of [[Napoleon III]]. Under [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris#Green space - the parks and gardens of Haussmann|Haussmann's renovation of Paris]],  the Bois de Boulogne was completed in 1858.&lt;ref name=&quot;moffett&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bailey&quot;&gt;Bailey, Colin B.

'''''Landscape with Psyche Outside the Palace of Cupid''''', or '''''The Enchanted Castle''''', 1664,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/paintings/landscape-with-psyche-outside-the-palace-of-cupid-the-enc114697 bbc]&lt;/ref&gt; is a painting, oil on canvas,  by [[Claude Lorrain]] in the [[National Gallery, London]]. It was commissioned by [[Lorenzo Onofrio Colonna]], a Roman aristocrat. Its subject is taken from ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' (IV-VI), by [[Apuleius]] – the love story of [[Cupid and Psyche|Psyche]] the soul, and [[Cupid]] the god of love. It is not clear if Psyche sits in front of Cupid's castle before she meets him, or after he has abandoned her.

It is sometimes thought – it is disputed – to have inspired the lines – ''Charm'd magic casements, opening on the foam/Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn'' , – in [[John Keats]]'s  &quot;[[Ode to a Nightingale]]&quot;.  Keats was fascinated by the picture.

'''''Across the black soil plans''''' is a [[1899 in art|1899]] painting by Australian artist [[George Washington Lambert]]. The landscape depicts a team of draft horses pulling a wagon heavily laden with wool bales. Lambert's &quot;best known bush image&quot;, ''Across the black soil plains'' was awarded the [[Wynne Prize]] in 1899.&lt;ref name=Retrospective&gt;{{cite web|title=Across the black soil plains 1899|url=http://nga.gov.au/Exhibition/Lambert/Detail.cfm?IRN=162263|website=George W Lambert Retrospective|publisher=National Gallery of Australia|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting had its inspiration in Lambert's experiences in droving sheep, seeing &quot;horse teams hauling heavily laden wool wagons across the bare, miry, flat lands of Snakes Plain from [[Warren, New South Wales|Warren]] to the railway station at [[Nevertire, New South Wales|Nevertire]].&quot;.&lt;ref name=Retrospective /&gt; 
{{quote|As a boy in the bush I did much work with draft [sic] horses ... [One] called Barney had such fine action and such imposing carriage ... and possibly what knowledge I displayed in connection with horses in ‘Black Soil Plains’ originated with my association with this exceptionally fine animal|George Washington Lambert|&lt;ref name=Retrospective /&gt;}}

Lambert composed the painting in a shed at its mother's house in [[Hornsby, New South Wales|Hornsby]], a suburb of Sydney. When working on the painting, Lambert placed the long and narrow canvas diagonally in the shed. Several names have been suggested as the model for the [[teamster]], including Jim Smith from the Warren district, Luke Rollins from [[Moree, New South Wales|Moree]] or Henry Sharkey, who carted a record load of wool from [[Louth, New South Wales|Louth]] to [[Bourke, New South Wales|Bourke]].&lt;ref name=Retrospective /&gt; 

The painting was a critical success with the [[Sydney Morning Herald]] stating &quot;‘In this long narrow canvas the young artist paints with astonishing vigour and sense of movement ... in every conceivable attitude the horses tug and strain at the heavy load.&quot;&lt;ref name=Retrospective /&gt;

The painting was acquired by the Art Gallery of New South Wales at the New South Wales Society of Artists exhibition in 1899 and remains part of its collection.&lt;ref name=Retrospective /&gt;&lt;ref name=AGNSW&gt;{{cite web|title=Across the black soil plains|url=http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/collection/works/550/|website=Collection|publisher=Art Gallery of New South Wales|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Golden Summer, Eaglemont''''' is an 1889 painting by Australian artist [[Arthur Streeton]]. Painted during a summer drought when Streeton was twenty-one years old, it is an idyllic depiction of sunlit, undulating plains in rural [[Heidelberg, Victoria|Heidelberg]] on [[Melbourne]]'s outskirts. [[Naturalism (arts)|Naturalistic]] yet poetic, and a conscious effort by Streeton to create his most epic work yet, it is a prime example of the artist's distinctive, high-keyed blue and gold palette, what he considered &quot;nature's scheme of colour in Australia&quot;. It is one of his most famous works and is considered a masterpiece of [[Australian Impressionism]].

==Background==
It was painted ''[[en plein air]]'' at an artists' camp established by Streeton at [[Eaglemont, Victoria|Mount Eagle]] (now Eaglemont), where he and other Australian Impressionists occupied an old weatherboard house. Streeton described the location in a letter to fellow painter [[Tom Roberts]], which he calls &quot;our hill of gold&quot;:

{{quote|I sit here in the upper circle surrounded by copper and gold, and smile with joy under my fly net as all the light, glory and quivering brightness passes slowly and freely before my eyes. Nothing happier than this. I shout and laugh at my immense wealth, all free and without responsibility. Who could steal this from me? No one.}}

==Critical reaction==
It was the first painting by an Australian-born artist to be exhibited at both the [[Royal Academy]] in [[London]], in 1890, and the [[Paris Salon]] the following year, where it was displayed with the title ''Golden Summer, Australia'', and won an award. One critic noted the popularity of ''Golden Summer, Eaglemont'' with &quot;the crowds that throng the Salon&quot;, saying that it was &quot;simply impossible&quot; to pass by the painting &quot;as it is utterly different from any other picture in the vast collection&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/8450318 &quot;The Australian Artists in Paris&quot;] (17 August 1892), ''The Argus''. Retrieved 24 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
It was acquired by Scottish shipbuilder [[Charles Mitchell (shipbuilder)|Charles Mitchell]] and remained part of his estate for several years until Streeton bought the painting back.

Ahead of its auction in Australia in 1924, [[Lionel Lindsay]] extolled the work in the hope that it would enter a public gallery:&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay, Lionel (28 November 1923). [http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article119180066 &quot;Golden Summer: Streeton's Masterpiece&quot;], ''Evening News''. Retrieved 11 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|This tranquil landscape, so simply yet so exquisitely fashioned, possesses for Australians a sentiment no other people may equally enjoy. It is the first great Australian landscape, untrammeled by picture making formula, to come from the hand of the native born. It is, therefore, historically the most important landscape in Australia.}}

It was acquired by a private collector for 1,000 [[Guinea (British coin)|guinea]]s, then a record for a painting by an Australian artist. It broke the same record in 1995 when it was purchased by the [[National Gallery of Australia]] for $3.5 million.

'''''View of Geelong''''' is an 1856 [[oil painting]] on canvas by [[Eugene von Guerard]]. The painting measures 154.5x89cm and is owned by the [[Geelong Art Gallery]] in Victoria, Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://collections.geelonggallery.org.au/emuwebgag/pages/gag/Display.php?irn=4937 View of Geelong]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} at the Geelong Gallery&lt;/ref&gt;

It was purchased from English composer [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] for $3.8M. The purchase is the second highest ever for an Australian work of art, with the top being $5.3M paid by the [[National Gallery of Australia]] for a portrait of [[Captain James Cook]] by [[John Webber]]. [http://www.heraldsun.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5478,19709055%255E2902,00.html]{{dead link|date=June 2014}}

Lloyd Webber had bought the painting in 1996 for A$1.98 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/arts/lloyd-webber-sells-geelong-masterpiece/2006/05/12/1146940719620.html&amp;cid=0&amp;ei=nBhwRIz2C4W6pwK9qZWOCw|title=Lloyd Webber sells Geelong masterpiece|date=12 May 2006|journal=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the painting was loaned to the Geelong Art Gallery, where it proved popular.&lt;ref name=&quot;sixslayings&quot;&gt;[http://www.geelonggallery.org.au/events/view_of_geelong.htm The future of a Geelong icon needs your support], Geelong Art Gallery {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928103221/http://www.geelonggallery.org.au/events/view_of_geelong.htm |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Lloyd Webber offered the painting for sale via auction house [[Christie's]] of [[London]], giving the Geelong Gallery first right of refusal. On July 7, 2006, the Geelong Gallery purchased the painting for permanent display in the Geelong Gallery, after being offered $1.5 million from the Victorian state government and the remainder being sought via a community fundraising appeal.

'''''Baigneuses: Deux nus dans un paysage exotique''''' (also called ''Bathers: Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape'' and ''Bañistas: dos desnudos en un paisaje exótico'') is an oil painting created circa 1905-06 by the French artist and theorist [[Jean Metzinger]] (1883–1956). ''Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape'' is a [[Proto-Cubism|Proto-Cubist]] work executed in a highly personal [[Divisionism|Divisionist]] style during the height of the [[Fauvism|Fauve]] period. The painting is now in the [[Carmen Cervera|Carmen Thyssen-Bornemisza]] Collection, Spain ([[:es:Colección Carmen Thyssen-Bornemisza|Colección Carmen Thyssen-Bornemisza]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://coleccioncarmenthyssen.es/artist/jean-metzinger/ Colección Carmen Thyssen‐Bornemisza, Jean Metzinger]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://coleccioncarmenthyssen.es/work/baigneuses-deux-nus-dans-un-paysage-exotique/ Colección Carmen Thyssen‐Bornemisza, ''Baigneuses: Deux nus dans un paysage exotique'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Jean Metzinger, c.1906, Femme au Chapeau (Woman with a Hat), oil on canvas, 44.8 x 36.8 cm, Korban Art Foundation..jpg|thumb|Jean Metzinger, c.1906, ''[[Femme au Chapeau|Femme au Chapeau (Woman with a Hat)]]'', oil on canvas, 44.8 x 36.8 cm, Korban Art Foundation]]
''Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape'' is an oil painting on canvas with dimensions 116 x 88.8&amp;nbsp;cm (45 3/8 by 35 in), signed ''Metzinger'' (lower right). The work—consistent in style with other works by Metzinger created circa 1905-1906, such as ''[[Femme au Chapeau|Femme au Chapeau (Woman with a Hat)]]''—represents two nude women, one seen from the rear and the other from a more frontal position, in a lush, tropical, or subtropical setting. The landscape contains a wide variety of exotic geometrized elements (trees, bushes, flowers, a lake or river, a mountain range and a partly cloudy sky). Metzinger's use of color in ''Two Nudes'' is extremely [[Fauvism|Fauve]]; quasi-pure reds, greens, blues and violets, juxtaposed in groups as if randomly.

While the two nudes are treated with rather natural colors, the rest of the canvas appears treated with more artificial tints, tones, hues and shades. Unlike other Fauve works of the same period by [[Henri Matisse]], [[André Derain]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] or [[Kees van Dongen]], Metzinger's composition is strongly [[Paul Cézanne|Cézannian]]. The vertical format and light colors of the sky and treatment of foreground and background elements create a flattening of spatial perspective, reminiscent of [[Georges Seurat]], or [[Paul Cézanne]]'s 'multiple viewpoints', his search for order, discipline and permanence. However, the brushstrokes and overall appearance are not at all Cézannian in nature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moser&quot;&gt;Joann Moser, 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, ''Pre-Cubist Works, 1904-1909'', The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J.

==History==
By 1905 [[Neo-Impressionism]] had witnessed a major resurgence, with recent exhibitions by [[Maximilien Luce]] ([[:fr:Eugène Druet|Galerie Druet]], March 1904), [[Paul Signac]] (Galerie Druet, December 1904), [[Georges Seurat]] ([[Salon des Indépendants]], 1905), [[Henri-Edmond Cross]] (Galerie Druet, March–April 1905). Metzinger's unique style of Neo-Impressionism resulted from the unification of several influences in addition to that of Seurat and Cézanne; that of [[Vincent van Gogh]], with his heavy impasto, dense brushstrokes; and—following posthumous retrospective exhibitions at the Salon d'Automne in 1903 and 1906—that of [[Paul Gauguin]], with its exotic sumptuousness and sensuality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moser&quot; /&gt; By this time Metzinger had already developed a full-fledged Divisionist facture with large, bold mosaic-like brushwork, beyond that of Cross or Signac.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robert Herbert&quot;&gt;Robert L. Herbert, 1968, Neo-Impressionism, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

In statement made circa 1907 regarding his mosaic-like Divisionism—where both size and direction of his cubes of color are fundamental to the rhythm of the painting—Metzinger cites parallels with Neo-Impressionism painters and [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] literature:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I ask of divided brushwork not the objective rendering of light, but iridescence and certain aspects of color still foreign to painting. I make a kind of chromatic versification and for syllables I use strokes which, variable in quantity, cannot differ in dimension without modifying the rhythm of a pictorial phraseology destined to translate the diverse emotions aroused by nature.&quot; (Metzinger, 1907)&lt;ref name=&quot;Moser&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jean Metzinger&quot;&gt;Jean Metzinger, ca. 1907, quoted in Georges Desvallières, ''La Grande Revue'', vol. 124, 1907, as cited in Robert L. Herbert, 1968, Neo-Impressionism, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This statement seems to relate directly to ''Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape'' as well as other works of the same period such as ''[[La danse, Bacchante (Metzinger)|La Danse (Bacchante)]]'', and ''[[Coucher de soleil no. 1 (Metzinger)|Coucher de soleil no. 1]]'' (ca.1906)&lt;ref name=&quot;Moser&quot; /&gt;

:&quot;Metzinger's Neo-Impressionist period was somewhat longer than that of his close friend Delaunay.&quot; Robert Herbert writes: &quot;At the Indépendants in 1905, his paintings were already regarded as in the Neo-Impressionist tradition by contemporary critics, and he apparently continued to paint in large mosaic strokes until some time in 1908. The height of his Neo-Impressionist work was in 1906 and 1907, when he and Delaunay did portraits of each other (Art market, London, and Museum of Fine Arts Houston) in prominent rectangles of pigment. (In the sky of ''[[Coucher de soleil no. 1 (Metzinger)|Coucher de soleil]]'', 1906-1907, Collection Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller is the solar disk which Delaunay was later to make into a personal emblem.)&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robert Herbert&quot; /&gt;

The vibrating image of the sun in Metzinger's painting, and so too of Delaunay's Paysage au disque (1906–1907), &quot;is an homage to the decomposition of spectral light that lay at the heart of Neo-Impressionist color theory...&quot; (Herbert, 1968) (See, Jean Metzinger, Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller, Otterlo)&lt;ref&gt;[http://kmm.nl/object/KM%20103.080%20RECTO/Landschap Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller, Otterlo]&lt;/ref&gt;

Each individual square of pigment associated with another of similar shape and color to form a group; each grouping of color juxtaposed with an adjacent collection of differing colors; just as syllables combine to form sentences, and sentences combine to form paragraphs, and so on. Now, the same concept formerly related to color has been adapted to form. Each individual facet associated with another adjacent shape form a group; each grouping juxtaposed with an adjacent collection of facets connect or become associated with a larger organization—just as the association of syllables combine to form sentences, and sentences combine to form paragraphs, and so on—forming what Metzinger would soon describe as the 'total image'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robert Herbert&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robbins, 1985&quot;&gt;Daniel Robbins, ''Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism'', 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press, pp. 9-23&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[bilateral symmetry]] inherent in ''Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape'' is striking (even if only as an approximation). The [[Proto-Cubism|proto-Cubist]] geometry is solidly constructed but the equilibrium is unstable or short-lived. Each tile of pigment juxtaposed one next to the other form a section of the painting: each section of the painting containing between 10 of 50 'tiles' dominated by blues, reds, and greens. There is no smooth transition between each section. The painting is divided, fragmented, splintered or faceted into series, not only of individual rectangles, squares or 'cubes' of color, but into individual planes or surfaces delineated by color and form, already pointing towards Cubism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mittelmann&quot;&gt;[http://jean-metzinger.blogspot.com.es/ Alex Mittelmann, 2012, ''Jean Metzinger, Divisionism, Cubism, Neoclassicism and Post Cubism'']&lt;/ref&gt;

That is not say that ''Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape'' belongs analytic or synthetic Cubism. It does not. The subject is viewed from one point of view, not several. There is no true 'mobile perspective', anymore than in the works of Cézanne or Seurat. But a departure from nature it was, and a departure from all that had been painted to date it was too; a precursor in style, certainly, one that would resurface in the works of Metzinger and others ([[Gino Severini]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Piet Mondrian]]) several years later, within the context of Cubism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mittelmann&quot; /&gt;

''Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape'' signified more that just the incorporation of a radical geometry that would free Metzinger and others from the confines of nature as any artwork executed in Europe to date. This indeed was Neo-Impressionism, Divisionism, albeit in a highly altered form. Beyond the decomposition of spectral light at the core of Neo-Impressionist color theory, ''Two Nudes'' surpassed the teachings of Cross or Signac. It contained &quot;iridescences&quot;, in Metzinger's terms, certain &quot;aspects of color still foreign to painting&quot;. It contained a &quot;chromatic versification&quot;, as if for syllables. The rhythm of its pictorial phraseology translated the diverse emotions aroused by nature. It no longer represented nature as seen, but was a complete byproduct of the human 'sensation.'&lt;ref name=&quot;Mittelmann&quot; /&gt;

Interestingly, an art critic by the name of Louis Chassevent, writing about the 1906 Salon des Indépendants, used the word &quot;cube&quot; with reference to Jean Metzinger and [[Robert Delaunay]], two and a half years before similar references would be made by [[Louis Vauxcelles]] to baptize the [[Proto-Cubism|Proto-Cubist]] or [[Cubism|Cubist]] works [[Pablo Picasso]] or [[Georges Braque]]. Recognizing the difference between Metzinger and his contemporaries Louis Chassevent wrote in 1906: 
:&quot;M. Metzinger is a mosaicist like M. Signac but he brings more precision to the cutting of his cubes of color which appear to have been made mechanically.&quot; (Robert Herbert, 1968, Neo-Impressionism, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York)&lt;ref name=&quot;Robert Herbert&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robbins, 1985&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Louis Chassevent, ''22e Salon des Indépendants'', 1906, ''Quelques petits salons'', Paris, 1908, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Daniel Robbins&quot;&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/albertgleizes1881robb#page/n3/mode/2up Daniel Robbins, 1964, ''Albert Gleizes 1881 – 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition'', Published by The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, in collaboration with Musée National d'Art Moderne, Paris, Museum am Ostwall, Dortmund]&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year Metzinger and Delaunay shared an exhibition at [[Berthe Weill]]'s gallery (1907). They were singled out by [[Louis Vauxcelles]] as Divisionists who used large, mosaic-like 'cubes' to construct small but highly symbolic compositions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robert Herbert&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Daniel Robbins&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.all-art.org/art_20th_century/metzinger1.html Art of the 20th Century]&lt;/ref&gt;

One and a half years later, November 1908, Vauxcelles, in his brief review of Georges Braque's exhibition at Kanhweiler's gallery, called Braque a daring man who despises form, &quot;reducing everything, places and a figures and houses, to geometric schemas, to cubes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Danchev&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iTzniDD6EwAC&amp;pg=PR123&amp;lpg=PR123&amp;dq=preface,+Exposition+Georges+Braque,+November+1908,+Galerie+Kahnweiler&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DZ4-_FKVK0&amp;sig=RjxOvhE7jDIbKCa4h8QkIRsoKnQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sCcxUfLbKa6A0AXIhoGADA&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=little%20cubes&amp;f=false Alex Danchev, ''Georges Braques: A Life'', Arcade Publishing, 15 nov. 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; '''Lot Notes:'''
The present work is one of a small number of Metzinger compositions fusing a broad, divisionist facture with a fauve palette. This group, which includes the celebrated ''Paysage coloré aux oiseaux exotiques'' (Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris), represented the artist's response to the Salon d'Automne of 1905, a review of which saw Louis Vauxcelles coin the term 'Fauve' to describe the circle of artists using bright colour and broad brushstrokes. While on this occasion Metzinger did not exhibit with Matisse, Braque and Vlaminck, since 1904 he had shown alongside these artists who were gaining notoriety as Fauves, notably at the Salons des Indépendants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In the departure from the Neo-Impressionist manner of Metzinger's early years, ''Baigneuses: Deux nus dans un paysage exotique'' substitutes the exuberant palette and broader handling of his peers. In both composition and facture though, the work retains a rather more rigorous structure than other Fauve landscapes of the period. It's arcadian subject and a mosaic-like application of paint give a uniquely individual flavour to what Metzinger termed his 'chromatic poetry'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2004/impressionist-modern-art-day-l04003/lot.251.html Sotheby's London, Impressionist &amp; Modern Art, Day Sale, 4 February 2004, Lot 251]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Coucher de soleil no. 1''''' (also called ''Landscape'', ''Paysage'', ''Landschap'', or ''Sunset No. 1'') is an oil painting created circa 1906 by the French artist and theorist [[Jean Metzinger]] (1883–1956). ''Coucher de soleil no. 1'' is a work executed in a mosaic-like [[Divisionism|Divisionist]] style with a [[Fauvism|Fauve]] palette. The reverberating image of the sun in Metzinger's painting is an homage to the decomposition of spectral light at the core of [[Neo-Impressionism|Neo-Impressionist]] color theory.

''Coucher de soleil'' was exhibited in Paris during the spring of 1907 at the [[Salon des Indépendants]] (n. 3457), along with ''[[La danse, Bacchante|Bacchante]]'' and four other works by Metzinger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p16028coll4/id/16983 Jean Metzinger, ''Coucher de soleil'', Société des artistes indépendants: catalogue de la 23ème exposition, 1907, no. 3457, p. 225]&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting had been in the collection of [[Helene Kröller-Müller]] since 1921 (or prior),&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogusvandesc00kr#page/154/mode/2up Catalogus van de schilderijen verzameling van Mevrouw H. Kröller-Müller, Samensteller H.P.

==Description==
''Coucher de soleil no. 1'' is an oil painting on canvas in a horizontal format with dimensions 72.5 x 100&amp;nbsp;cm (28.5 by 39.25 in), signed ''J.Metzinger'' (lower right), and titled on the verso &quot;Coucher de soleil no. 1&quot;. Also on the verso is another painting by Metzinger representing a river scene with ships. The work represents two nude women relaxing in a lush Mediterranean landscape with semi-tropical vegetation, hills, trees, a body of water and a radiating setting sun beyond.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert&quot;&gt;Robert Herbert, ''Neo-Impressionism'', The Solomon R.

The two nudes appear to play a secondary role in the overall composition due to their small size. But their prominent location in the foreground and the provocative nature of [[public nudity]] propels them to a position that cannot be ignored.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert&quot; /&gt;

In this luscious setting—as in ''[[Luxe, Calme et Volupté]]'' by [[Henri Matisse]]—Metzinger makes use all the colors in the [[spectrum]] of visible [[light]]. Unlike Matisse's work, Metzinger's brushstrokes are large, forming a mosaic-like lattice of squares or cubes of similar size and shape throughout, juxtaposed in a wide variety of angles relative to one another, creating an overall rhythm that would otherwise not be present.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert&quot; /&gt;

Evidence suggests that this work was completed prior to Metzinger's paintings entitled ''[[La danse, Bacchante|La danse (Bacchante)]]'' or ''[[Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape]]'': (1) there exists an oil on canvas study of the latter dated circa 1905-1906, located at the University of Iowa with the title ''Two Nudes in a garden'', 91.4 x 63.8&amp;nbsp;cm with a similar radiating sun above the bathers. (2) The brushstrokes are smaller in size consistent with Metzinger's style of late 1905. (3) In 1906 and 1907 Metzinger's brushstrokes became larger and more organized, structured within a highly geometrized framework already [[Proto-Cubism|proto-Cubist]] in appearance. (4) As its name implies, ''Coucher de soleil no. 1'' might have been the first in a series of sunsets. Though no other works by Metzinger are known by the titles ''Coucher de soleil no. 2'' or ''No. 3'', the artist did produce other works with sunsets during the same period: ''Landscape with Fountain'', for example, an oil on canvas measuring 53.3 x 73.6&amp;nbsp;cm; ''Paysage pointilliste'', 1906-07, an oil on canvas measuring 54.5 x 73&amp;nbsp;cm; ''Matin au Parc Montsouris'', ca. 1906, oil on canvas, 49.9 x 67.7&amp;nbsp;cm; or even ''La tour de Batz au coucher de soleil'', 54 x 73&amp;nbsp;cm, an oil on canvas ca. 1905.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert&quot; /&gt;

Indeed, these clues would seem to suggest ''Coucher de soleil no. 1'' was painted during the later months of 1905, or early 1906, just before Metzinger and [[Robert Delaunay]] began painting portraits of one another,&lt;ref&gt;Joann Moser, ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, Pre-Cubist works, 1904–1909'', The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press, 1985, pp. 34-42&lt;/ref&gt; rather than circa 1908 as indicated by the Kröller-Müller Museum.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kröller-Müller&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert&quot; /&gt;

==Neo-Impressionism, Divisionism==
[[File:Matisse-Luxe.jpg|thumb|240px|right|[[Henri Matisse]], 1904, ''[[Luxe, Calme et Volupté]]'', oil on canvas, 98.5 × 118.5 cm (37 x 46 in), [[Musée d'Orsay]], Paris]] 
The [[Fauvism|Fauves]] (many of whom would become [[Cubism|Cubists]]), were heavily influenced by [[Neo-Impressionism]], calling upon rational and scientific thought and creating highly abstract visions with the goal of producing the effects of real color-light. Mechanical brushwork suppressed the personality of the artist in an act of conspicuous defiance against the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert&quot; /&gt; The [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]] too would strip away the casual and accidental features of reality, revealing the true 'essence of form.' Whether such a revelation could be backed up by a scientific theory or not, there were still examples that could be codified. The problem was that pigments ''reflect'' light, they are not a light source themselves. Colors in the spectra of light did not respond in the same way as color pigments painted on canvas. For example, red and blue light rays result in white light, but the same colors in pigments make violet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mittelmann&quot;&gt;[http://cubism-coldcreation.blogspot.com.es/ Alexander Mittelmann., ''State of the Modern Art World, The Essence of Cubism and its Evolution in Time'', 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Daniel Robbins&quot;&gt;Daniel Robbins, ''Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism'', 1985, in ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect'', The University of Iowa Museum of Art&lt;/ref&gt;

Metzinger's response in ''Coucher de soleil no. 1'', in addition to illustrating actual radiation emanating in concentric circles from the sun, was to separate colors in such a way as to avoid mixtures, leading to inert tones. Contrary to the Impressionists related hues, often placed on top of one another while still wet—leading to a result the Divisionists found dull—contrasting hues placed side by side for the effect or creating optical vibrations were essential to Divisionists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mittelmann&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Daniel Robbins&quot; /&gt;

The basic elements of art—the line, particle of color—like words could be treated autonomously, each possessing an abstract value independent of one another, if so chose the artist. The line, independent of its topographical role, possesses an calculable abstract value, in addition to the particles of color and the relation of both to the observer's emotion. The underlying theory behind Neo-Impressionsim, something Divisionists like the Metzinger would push to the extreme, would have a lasting affect on the works produced in the coming years by [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Robert Delaunay]] and [[Gino Severini]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mittelmann&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Robert Delaunay, c.1906, Paysage au disque solaire, oil on canvas, 54 x 46 cm, Musée National d'Art Moderne.jpg|thumb|left|[[Robert Delaunay]], 1906-07, ''Paysage au disque'', oil on canvas, 54 x 46 cm, [[Musée National d'Art Moderne]], Paris]]
[[File:Robert Delaunay, 1913, Premier Disque, 134 cm, 52.7 inches, Private collection.jpg|thumb|left|[[Robert Delaunay]], 1912-1913, ''Le Premier Disque'', 134 cm (52.7 in), Private collection]]
The impulse toward abstraction was a primary quality of the time, even prior to Metzinger's ''Sunset No. 1''. &quot;Neo-Impressionism&quot; wrote [[Paul Adam (French novelist)|Paul Adam]], &quot;wants to reproduce the pure phenomenon, the subjective appearance of things. It is a school of abstraction.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mittelmann&quot; /&gt;

By &quot;abstract,&quot; writes Robert Herbert, &quot;writers and painters of the period did not mean &quot;devoid of reference to the real world&quot;, as we now use the term. They meant to draw away from nature, in the sense of disdaining imitation in order to concentrate upon the distillation of essential shapes and movements. These distilled forms were superior to nature because they partook of ''idea'', and represented the dominance of the artist over the mere stuff of nature. In embryo, the Symbolists and Neo-Impressionists did establish the philosophical defense of pure abstraction, but nature still formed part of the basic dialogue.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mittelmann&quot; /&gt;

By 1905 Metzinger began to favor the abstract qualities of larger brushstrokes and luminous colors. Following the lead of [[Georges Seurat]], [[Henri-Edmond Cross]] and [[Paul Cézanne]], Metzinger began incorporating a new geometry into his works that signified a further departure still from naturalism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mittelmann&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Daniel Robbins&quot; /&gt;

Robert Herbert writes of Metzinger's ''Coucher de soleil'' and its importance during the Neo-Impressionist period and thereafter:
:&quot;At the Indépendants in 1905, his paintings were already regarded as in the Neo-Impressionist tradition by contemporary critics, and he apparently continued to paint in large mosaic strokes until some time in 1908. The height of his Neo-Impressionist work was in 1906 and 1907, when he and Delaunay did portraits of each other [...] in prominent rectangles of pigment. (In the sky of [Coucher de soleil, 1906-1907, Collection Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller] is the solar disk which Delaunay was later to make into a personal emblem.)&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mittelmann&quot; /&gt;

The vibrating image of the sun in Metzinger's painting, and of Delaunay's ''Paysage au disque'' (1906-1907), writes Herbert, &quot;is an homage to the decomposition of spectral light that lay at the heart of Neo-Impressionist color theory...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mittelmann&quot; /&gt;

&quot;The Neo-Impressionists&quot; according to Maurice Denis, &quot;inaugurated a vision, a technique, and esthetic based on the recent discoveries of physics, on a scientific conception of the world and of life.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mittelmann&quot; /&gt;

In 1904-05 [[Henri Poincaré]] discovered a graphical tool for visualizing different types of polarized light (known as Poincaré sphere). The [[Poincaré homology sphere]], also called Poincaré dodecahedral space, is a particular example of a homology sphere. Being a [[spherical 3-manifold]], it is the only homology 3-sphere, besides the [[3-sphere]] itself, with a finite [[fundamental group]]. While it is not known the extent to which such discoveries influenced Metzinger's representation of the radiating sun in ''Coucher de soleil no. 1'', his interest and prowess in mathematics is well documented.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daniel Robbins&quot; /&gt;

'''''L'Arbre (The Tree)''''', is a painting created in 1910 by the French artist, theorist and writer [[Albert Gleizes]]. Executed in an advanced [[Proto-Cubism|Proto-Cubist]] style, the work was exhibited in Paris at the [[Salon des Indépendants]], 1910 (no. 2160), the following year Gleizes chose to exhibit this work at the Salon de la [[Section d'Or]], Galerie La Boétie, 1912 (no. 34), and Manes Moderni Umeni, S.V.U., Vystava, Prague, 1914 (no. 33). The painting was again shown at the Grand Palais, Salon des Indépendants, ''Trente ans d'art indépendant'', in 1926. ''L'Arbre'', an important work of 1910, appeared at the decisive Salon des Indépendants of 1911, where [[Cubism]] emerged as a group manifestation and spread like a wave across the globe, shocking the general public in its wake.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Varichon, Daniel Robbins, ''Albert Gleizes, Catalogue raisonné'', volume I, Paris, 1998, no. 345 (illustrated p. 127).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''L'Arbre (The Tree)'' is an oil painting on canvas with dimensions 92&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;73.2&amp;nbsp;cm ({{frac|36|1|4}} by {{frac|28|5|8}} inches), signed and dated ''Albert Gleizes 10'', lower right.

Gleizes practically subjugates The Tree in the foreground—its thin trunk slightly off-center and foliage cropped at the top—to a secondary role within a meticulously geometric ''[[World landscape]]''. Here, the receding landscape marked by protruding hills and steep cliff-like formations, is perhaps more naturalistic than the core group of Gleizes' subsequent 1911–12 landscapes (e.g., ''[[Le Chemin, Paysage à Meudon (Gleizes)|Le Chemin (Paysage à Meudon)]]'', 1911, and ''[[Les Baigneuses (Gleizes)|Les Baigneuses (The Bathers)]]'', 1912) yet does not replicate any other known painting (or specific location) in any of its parts. This fact strongly points towards it being an invention born out of Gleizes' studio.

Gleizes' method was fundamentally synthetic. Although the landscape seems persuasively realistic (with its foreground, background and village in between), it is not an existing place somewhere between Paris and his studio at Courbevoie, consistent with Gleizes' method of bringing together various elements from different locations anteriorly observed in nature.

The superposition of hills with a succession of brown, grey and white planes throughout this painting—providing a sense of temporal duration and spatial extension to the immense vista—along with the cubic architectural structures cutting through the center of the canvas, each with its own perspective, are very typical of the core group of Gleizes' landscapes. The divers elements are combined in such a way that avoids symmetry; a characteristic found in several of the artists landscapes, painted before and after ''L'Arbre'', each a unique creation.

Daniel Robbins writes of ''The Tree (L'Arbre)'' and related works in the catalogue of the Gleizes Retrospective at the Guggenheim, New York (1964):

&lt;blockquote&gt;In this work, one of Gleizes' most important paintings of the crucial year 1910, we see the artist's volumetric approach to Cubism and his successful union of a broad field of vision with a flat picture plane. Earlier studies, such as ''By the Seine (Bord de la Seine, Meudon)'' of 1909, and ''Road, Trees and Houses (Environs de Meudon)'' of 1910 (both in the collection of Walter Firpo), clearly anticipate this development.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robbins 1964&quot;&gt;[http://openlibrary.org/books/OL5921018M/Albert_Gleizes_1881-1953 ''Albert Gleizes 1881–1953, a retrospective exhibition'', Daniel Robbins. The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, in collaboration with Musée national d'art moderne, Paris; Museum am Ostwall, Dortmund, published 1964]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During his trip to Bagnères sur Bigorre, Gascony, in 1909 Gleizes concentrated exclusively on landscapes, reducing natural forms to primary shapes. His effort to portray the complex rhythms of a panorama resulted in &quot;a comprehensive geometry of intersecting and overlapping forms which created a new and more dynamic quality of movement&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robbins 1964&quot; /&gt;

His 1911 ''Paysage à Meudon'' followed, in which &quot;Man is reintroduced, but subordinated to the heroic concept of landscape which simultaneously comprehends the close and the distant, the earth's curve, the sun, even the force of wind against trees&quot;. (Robbins, 1964)&lt;ref name=&quot;Robbins 1964&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==1910 in brief==
Gleizes writes in his ''Souvenirs''&lt;ref name=&quot;Gleizes, Souvenirs&quot;&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a%26r/Du%20Cubisme/souvenirs.html Albert Gleizes, ''Souvenirs - Le Cubisme, 1908-1914'', Cahiers Albert Gleizes, Association des Amis d'Albert Gleizes, Lyon, 1957. Reprinted, Association des Amis d'Albert Gleizes, Ampuis, 1997. Translation and notes by Peter Brooke]&lt;/ref&gt; of the crucial year 1910:

&lt;blockquote&gt;After painting a series of pictures, some of which are still in existence today, I was still dissatisfied and yet better prepared for experiments that would go deeper. It was in 1910 that, for the first time, I showed in the ''Salon des Indépendants'' and completely abandoned the salon of the ''Nationale'', where there was nothing more for me to do. I sent to the Cours-la-Reine a full figure, a full sized portrait of the poet René Arcos, as well as two landscapes of the area round Paris, simple collections of masses in restrained colours. From that moment onwards, I can see it clearly now, my researches passed from the surface to the interior of the plastic problem. So 1910 brought another white stone to my life, as it would mark a stage which, if it was not conclusive, would at least be very positive. Above all in the second half of that year, when I painted the canvasses which would appear in the ''Salon des Indépendants'' of 1911.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gleizes, Souvenirs&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gleizes met [[Jean Metzinger]] and [[Robert Delaunay]] in 1910, through [[Alexandre Mercereau]], but had only vague knowledge of the work they showed at the [[Salon des Indépendants]] that same year. Gleizes too had exhibited at the same salon. Most importantly, Gleizes had read an article which had struck him, written by Jean Metzinger for the young literary review, ''Pan'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Note sur la peinture&quot;&gt;Jean Metzinger, ''Note sur la peinture'', Pan (Paris), October–November 1910&lt;/ref&gt; run by two young poets, [Marcel Rieu] and Jean Clary. The [[Hellenic studies|anti-Hellenic]] concept of representing a subject from multiple points of view was a central idea of Jean Metzinger's ''Note sur la Peinture'' article of 1910. It was at the ''Indépendants'' of 1910 that Metzinger showed a portrait of Guillaume Apollinaire which Apollinaire in his book ''The Cubist Painters'', 1913, claimed was the first Cubist portrait.&lt;ref&gt;Guillaume Apollinaire, ''Méditations esthétiques. Les peintres cubistes (The Cubist Painters)'', Edition Figuière, Paris, 1913&lt;/ref&gt; Gleizes continues writing in his ''Souvenirs'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;1910 was the year in which, in its last months, a more or less coherent group began to form from certain tendencies which were quite clearly present in our generation but had previously been scattered. Painters saw what they had in common, poets joined them, feelings of sympathy were established, a general atmosphere began to form which would soon produce an action whose effects were to be quickly felt in the surrounding world. Painters and writers would support each other, moved as they all were by a single faith. (Albert Gleizes, Souvenirs)&lt;ref name=&quot;Gleizes, Souvenirs&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Le Chemin, Paysage à Meudon''''' also known as '''''Paysage avec personage''''', is an oil on canvas painted in 1911 by the artist, theorist and writer [[Albert Gleizes]]. The work was exhibited at the [[Salon des Indépendants]] during the spring of 1911, Paris; Les Indépendants, Musée moderne de Bruxelles, 1911; Galeries J. Dalmau, ''Exposicio d'art cubista'', Barcelona, 1912; Galerie La Boétie, ''Salon de La [[Section d'Or]]'', 1912.&lt;ref name=&quot;Musées Nationaux&quot;&gt;[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/mnrbis_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&amp;FIELD_1=REF&amp;VALUE_1=MNAM0001 Site Rose-Valland, Musées Nationaux Récupération]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Le Chemin'' was identified by [[Hector Feliciano]] as having been plundered by the Nazis from the home of collector [[Alphonse Kann]] during [[World War II]]. It was returned to the heirs of Alphonse Kann in July 1997 and placed at public auctions in New York (1999) and London (2010) respectively.

==Description==
''Le Chemin, Paysage à Meudon'' is an oil painting on canvas with dimensions 146.4 x 114.4&amp;nbsp;cm (57.6 by 45 inches), signed and dated 'Albert Gleizes 1911' (lower right); signed again and titled 'Alb Gleizes Paysage' (on the reverse). This work, painted at the outset of 1911, represents a human figure walking through a hilly landscape with trees, houses or villas, a bridge over the [[Seine]] river, and a town with a church (possibly the Paroisse de Saint-Cloud) on the 'horizon', consistent with elements of the town in the southwestern suburbs of Paris, [[Meudon]].

The term 'Cubism' was employed for the first time in June 1911 by [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], speaking in the context of the Indépendants exhibition in Brussels which included this work by Gleizes, along with others by [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Fernand Léger]], and [[Henri Le Fauconnier]]. During the summer, Gleizes was in close contact with [[Jean Metzinger]], who had recently moved to Meudon. Gleizes too lived and worked in the western suburbs of Paris (''la [[banlieue]] ouest''), 24 Avenue Gambetta, [[Courbevoie]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/images/detail/armory-show-entry-form-albert-gleizes-painting-la-femme-aux-phlox-14516 Armory Show entry form for Albert Gleizes' painting ''La Femme aux Phlox''].

They had long conversations about the nature of form and perception. They agreed that traditional painting gave a static and incomplete idea of the subject as experienced in life. Things, they would conclude, are in fact dynamic, observed to move, are seen from different angles and can be captured at successive moments in time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter Brooke&quot; /&gt;

''Paysage à Meudon'', Gleizes' largest painting to date, is the principal product of &quot;rodage&quot; (a term used by Gleizes himself) with Jean Metzinger. In his ''Cubism in the Shadow of War: The Avant-Garde and Politics in Paris, 1905-1914'', David Cottington writes of ''Paysage à Meudon'':

:&quot;The classical armature and Claudian image of Gleizes' picture are both overlaid with a pattern of planes and facets that fragments forms, combines perspectives and complicates the relation between spaces and volumes, but does little to disrupt the conventional spatial recession.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;David Cottington&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=es&amp;id=o3vSvh8CytIC&amp;q=meudon#v=snippet&amp;q=meudon&amp;f=false David Cottington,''Cubism in the Shadow of War: The Avant-Garde and Politics in Paris, 1905-1914'', Yale University Press, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as in the works of Metzinger, and unlike those of [[Pablo Picasso]] or [[Georges Braque]] of the same period, Gleizes had no interest in the flattening of the entire surface, of fusing background and foreground to the point where all spatial depth of field was abandoned. Yet Gleizes made use of fragmentation of form, multiple perspective views (i.e., mobile and dynamic, rather than static and from one point-of-view) along with linear and planar structural qualities. Gleizes' ''[[Les Baigneuses (Gleizes)|Les Baigneuses (The Bathers)]]'' of the following year employs the same concept of multiple perspective, but not at the expense of vacating spatial depth. Though highly sophisticated in theory, this aspect of [[simultaneity]] would actually become quite commonly employed within the practices of the [[Section d'Or]] group. Gleizes deployed these techniques in ''&quot;a radical, personal and coherent manner&quot;'' (Cottington, 1998).&lt;ref name=&quot;David Cottington&quot; /&gt;

In his catalogue preface for the 1911 Indépendants de Bruxelles,&lt;ref&gt;Preface, ''Catalogue of 8th Salon annuel du Cercle d'art Les Indépendants, Musée moderne de Bruxelles, 10 June - 3 July 1911''&lt;/ref&gt; Guillaume Apollinaire wrote of this painting, titled ''Le chemin'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Il est sorti un art simple et noble, expressif et mesuré, ardent à la recherche de la beauté et tout prêt à aborder ces vastes sujets que les peintre d'hier n'osaient entreprendre.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gleizes' [[Proto-Cubism|Proto-Cubist]] work entitled ''[[L'Arbre, The Tree (Gleizes)|L'Arbre (The Tree)]]'' exhibited at the 1910 [[Salon des Indépendants]] in Paris was the point of departure for ''Paysage à Meudon''. Visibly distant from the work of Picasso or Braque, ''Paysage à Meudon'' is stylistically much closer to Metzinger, Le Fauconnier, Léger and Delaunay. Gleizes' interpretation of space in a succession of plans and simple geometric lines descends directly from the teachings of [[Paul Cézanne]]. These same aesthetic preoccupations would unite several artists that formed a group and held meetings in Puteaux, at the Duchamp residence. For their first public manifestation as a group—the Salon de la [[Section d'Or]] of 1912—Gleizes chose to present this 1911 landscape (no. 39 of the catalogue), along with [[Les Baigneuses (Gleizes)|Les Baigneuses]] and the monumental ''[[Harvest Threshing|Le Dépiquage des Moissons (Harvest Threshing)]]'' both of 1912.&lt;ref&gt;''Collection, Musée national d'Art moderne'', Edition du Centre Pompidou, Paris, 1986, {{ISBN|2-85850-292-7}}, pp. 247, 248&lt;/ref&gt;

In their Lot Notes for the 1999 sale, Christie's writes:

:In 1911, Albert Gleizes was at the height of his artistic powers and Paysage Meudon is one the artist's most celebrated paintings. [...] In the present work, Gleizes retained a traditional sense of perspective and employed the use of a vanishing point in the road and the houses in the background. There is a logical dimunition of form, and in this respect Gleizes' Cubism retained his singular vision of imposing a sense of weight and volumetric relationships to his subjects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christie's 1999&quot;&gt;[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/lot/albert-gleizes-paysage-meudon-1609515-details.aspx?intObjectID=1609515#top Christie's, New York, Rockefeller Plaza, Sale 9224, 20th Century Art (Evening Sale), 9 November 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

In their Lot Notes for the 2010 sale, Christie's writes:

:''Le Chemin (Meudon)'' is a large and important painting made by Albert Gleizes in the summer of 1911 at the height of his new friendship and collaboration with fellow Cubist Jean Metzinger. One of his largest and most ambitious paintings from this period, made in direct response to the inspiration of Metzinger, it was exhibited by Gleizes at the groundbreaking exhibition of the so-called 'Salon Cubists', Robert Delaunay, Fernand Léger, Henri Le Fauconnier and Gleizes, at the Salon des Indépendants in June 1911.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christie's 2010&quot;&gt;[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/albert-gleizes-le-chemin-5334975-details.aspx#top Christie's, London, King Street, Sale 7857, Impressionist/Modern Evening Sales, Lot 38, 23 June 2010. Lot Notes]&lt;/ref&gt; With its prismatic Cubism, shifting multiple perspective points and its holistic integration of landscape and figure centred around this lone figures journey through a path in the woods and through the heart of the picture, this work represents a radical extension of Gleizes' Cubism into an entirely new integrated and simultaneous style of composition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christie's 2010&quot; /&gt;

The Salon des Indépendants at which ''Le Chemin (Meudon)'' had been exhibited was held from 21 April to 13 June in the spring of 1911; so Gleizes' painting could not possibly have been made &quot;in the summer of 1911&quot; as stated in the Christie's catalogue notes.

==History==
[[Alphonse Kann]] had been admired for his extraordinary taste and keen eye. Before the war his collection included at least thirty-five paintings by [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], in addition to many others by artists such as [[Georges Braque|Braque]], [[Paul Klee|Klee]], [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]], [[Édouard Manet|Manet]], [[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]]. ''Paysage à Meudon'' was among approximately 130 works that had been looted from the Kann collection by the German Occupation Army in 1940. The National Museums of Recuperations recovered ''Paysage à Meudon'' in 1949 and it subsequently went into the collection of the [[Musée National d'Art Moderne]], Paris. On 11 July 1997 the Musée National d'Art Moderne returned Gleizes' ''Paysage à Meudon'', stolen by Nazi occupiers during the Second World War, to the heirs of the art collector Alphonse Kann.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christie's 1999&quot; /&gt;

Didier Schulman, a curator at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]], confirmed the return of the painting to Francois Warin, grand-nephew of Alphonse Kann. The Gleizes painting was one of 2,000 objects returned to France from Germany after the war. If a work remained unclaimed, they were temporarily entrusted to museums. These artworks are known as National Museum Recovery (NMR). Francois Warin learned of the Gleizes painting from a book written in 1997 by the journalist [[Hector Feliciano]], ''The Lost Museum'', which traces the fate of many works confiscated by the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;Hector Feliciano, ''The Lost Museum, The Nazi Conspiracy to Steal the World's Greatest Works of Art'', p. 215; New York, Basic Books, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-465-04194-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee Yanowith&quot;&gt;[http://www.museum-security.org/97/july14.html France returns artwork looted by Nazis to owner, Reuters, 14 July 1997]&lt;/ref&gt;

Feliciano found Gleizes' ''Landscape'' while researching his book. The painting was listed in documents of the [[Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg]] (ERR), a Nazi government branch that supervised the confiscation of artworks in France. Feliciano said that after plundering the painting, the Nazis brought it to the [[Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume]] in Paris where confiscated artworks were deposited.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee Yanowith&quot; /&gt;

&quot;For the Germans it was [[degenerate art]] so they bartered it or sold it for the type of paintings they liked,&quot; said Feliciano. Because the Nazis considered [[Cubism]], [[Futurism]] and [[Impressionism]] &quot;degenerate&quot;, German art dealers were able to inexpensively acquire them or exchange them for less valuable works that the Nazis coveted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee Yanowith&quot; /&gt;
 
France's [[Court of Audit (France)|Cour des Comptes]], a state spending 'watchdog' charged with conducting financial and legislative audits of public and private institutions, accused the museums of failing in their legal duty to seek out the owners or heirs of the works, including paintings by [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Paul Cézanne]] and sculptures by [[Auguste Rodin]]. In an attempt to rebut the charges, French authorities put 900 of the MNRs on exhibit in five national museums, including [[The Louvre]] and the Pompidou Centre. Gleizes' ''Paysage à Meudon'' was among them. The state-museum network explained that few or none of the works in its possession were looted from Jews, but were sold to the Nazis by collaborationist dealers in the wartime Parisian art market.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee Yanowith&quot; /&gt; However, works such as the Gleizes, were indeed seized from Jews deported to death camps or fleeing persecution, or sold under duress at rock-bottom prices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee Yanowith&quot; /&gt;

Feliciano accused state museums of doing nothing to try and return the MNRs to their owners. Warin had to wait a year to recover the work after his original claim, even though documents listing the Gleizes were in France's Foreign Ministry archives.

&quot;This is proof the museums haven't done their job for 50 years,'' Feliciano said. &quot;They had these documents in their hands.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee Yanowith&quot; /&gt;

==''Paysage près de Paris''==
''Le Chemin'' was not the only work by Gleizes to be looted by the Nazis: ''Paysage près de Paris'', also referred to as ''Landschaft bei Paris'' and ''Paysage de Courbevoie'', 1912, an oil on canvas of dimensions 72.8 x 87.1&amp;nbsp;cm, has been missing from Hannover since 1937.

'''''Les Baigneuses''''' (also known as '''''The Bathers'''''), is a large oil painting created at the outset of 1912 by the French artist, theorist and writer [[Albert Gleizes]] (1881–1953). It was exhibited at the [[Société des Artistes Indépendants|Salon des Indépendants]] in Paris during the spring of 1912; the Salon de la [[Société Normande de Peinture Moderne]], Rouen, summer 1912; and the Salon de la [[Section d'Or]], autumn 1912.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/viewer/exhibit-catalog-salon-de-la-section-dor-15197 Exhibit catalog for Salon de &quot;La Section d'Or&quot;, 1912.

''Les Baigneuses'', while still 'readable' in the [[Figurative art|figurative]] or [[Representation (arts)|representational]] sense, exemplifies the mobile, dynamic fragmentation of form and multiple perspective characteristic of Cubism at the outset of 1912. Highly sophisticated, both in theory and in practice, this aspect of [[simultaneity]] would soon become identified with the practices of the [[Section d'Or]] group.

==Description==
[[File:Albert Gleizes, 1911, Dessin pour les Baigneuses, published in La Revue de France et des pays français, February - March 1912.jpg|thumb|230px|Albert Gleizes, 1911, ''Dessin pour les Baigneuses'', published in ''La Revue de France et des pays français'', February - March 1912]]
''Les Baigneuses'' is an oil painting on canvas with dimensions 105 x 171&amp;nbsp;cm (41.3 by 67.3 inches), signed Albert Gleizes and dated 1912, lower left. This work, painted at the outset of 1912, represents a series of naked elegant women at various points in the landscape foreground, their reflections along with the blue of the sky echoing off the water at the lower edge of the canvas. Beyond the bathers can be observed protruding rock-like formations or boulders—with highlights of [[primary color]]—that appear to espouse elements of the foreground. Above these cliffs are found several [[deciduous]] woody plants of the genus [[Populus]]. Though native to many areas of the [[Northern Hemisphere]], the Poplar, with its fastigiate branches tapered towards the top, is especially iconic of the western suburbs of Paris (''la [[banlieue]] ouest'') where Gleizes lived, 24 Avenue Gambetta, [[Courbevoie]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/images/detail/armory-show-entry-form-albert-gleizes-painting-la-femme-aux-phlox-14516 Armory Show entry form for Albert Gleizes' painting ''La Femme aux Phlox''], not after 1913. Walt Kuhn family papers, and Armory Show records, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution. Document shows Gleizes' address&lt;/ref&gt; The Gleizes family moved to Avenue Gambetta in 1887.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter Brooke&quot;&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a%26r/a%26rintro Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1881-1953'']&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the 19th century and extending through the early 20th century, Courbevoie witnessed a rapid growth in population, and a surge in the development of crafts, industry and transport (including rail). Of course, such a scene of naked bathers would have been unthinkable in Courbevoie, or anywhere else near the Parisian capital.

===Optimistic reconciliation===
''Les Baigneuses''—as [[Robert Delaunay]]'s 1912 ''City of Paris'', and to some extent [[Jean Metzinger]]'s 1913 ''Meudon Landscape''—juxtaposes sharply contrasting elements. On the one hand the artist includes elements from a society in the process of inexorable industrialization, and on the other, the sereneness of timeless classical nude figures (something rarely painted by Gleizes, as Brooke points out). Yet the relationships between the two are formally resolved. This aspect of simultaneity—the optimistic reconciliation of classical tradition and contemporary life—was of particular interest to Gleizes, as it was to the [[Section d'Or]] group of Cubists (also known as the Passy group, or Puteaux group).&lt;ref name=&quot;Daniel Robbins&quot;&gt;[https://archive.org/details/albertgleizes1881robb Daniel Robbins, 1964, ''Albert Gleizes 1881 - 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition'', The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, in collaboration with Musée National d'Art Moderne, Paris, Museum am Ostwall, Dortmund.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The background forms a semi-urban landscape that possesses both rural and semi-industrial components, consistent with Courbevoie of the 1910s (except perhaps for the rock-like outcrops), a village or town with delicate smokestacks or factory chimneys billowing smoke that blends into the cloudy sky. Evidence that factories were already located on the Seine (billowing smoke) can be seen in Gleizes' ''Péniches et fumées à Courbevoie'' of 1908.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondationgleizes.fr/fr/gleize/page/albert-gleizes/son-uvre Albert Gleizes, 1908, ''Péniches et fumées à Courbevoie'', Fondation Albert Gleizes, Paris]&lt;/ref&gt; The statuesque nudes themselves are highly stylized, divided into geometrized facets, planes and curves, yet they are graceful, balletic and elegant. The source of light, rather than beaming down from one particular direction, appears to emanate from within the canvas itself, with an intensification in the vicinity of the bathers.

The [[Île de la Jatte]] (or Île de la Grande Jatte) is an island over which Gleizes would have passed on his way to and from the center of Paris. The island is well known as the setting for [[Georges Seurat]]'s ''[[A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte]]'' (1884), and his ''[[Bathers at Asnières]]'', in the background of which smoke emanating from industrial factories of [[Clichy, Hauts-de-Seine|Clichy]] can be observed; just as in Gleizes' ''Baigneuses'']]
Gleizes painted [[:fr:Île de la Jatte|L'île de la Jatte]] many times since 1901 and on at least five occasions between 1907 to 1912:

* 1907–1909, ''L'île de la Grande Jatte ou Bord de parc avec rivière animée de canots'', pastel pierre noire and ink on bistre paper, {{nobr|25 × 41.5 cm}}, private collection
* 1908, ''Péniches et fumées à Courbevoie'', Crayon, ink and gouache on paper, 23 x 32.5&amp;nbsp;cm, Fondation Albert Gleizes (Paris)
* 1908, ''L'île de la Grande Jatte'', fusain and gouache on rose paper, {{nobr|25 × 41.5 cm}}, [[Musée national d'art moderne]] (Paris)
* 1908, ''La Seine près de Courbevoie'', oil on canvas, {{nobr|54 × 65 cm}}, [[:fr:Musée Roybet Fould|Musée Roybet Fould]] (Courbevoie)
* 1908, ''Barque à Courbevoie'', fusain and chalk on paper, 30 x 38&amp;nbsp;cm, art market (Paris)

The subject matter of ''Les Baigneuses'', much as that of his monumental ''[[Harvest Threshing]]'' of the same year, is derived from an unsentimental observation of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter Brooke&quot; /&gt;

Gleizes' interest centered on many things in the years leading up to 1912, one of which was the dynamic qualities of modern urban life. ''Les Baigneuses'', depicts &quot;a harmonious and balanced landscape in which industrial and urban elements are imbricated with the surrounding countryside;&quot; writes Cottington in ''Cubism in the Shadow of War'', &quot;Poussinesque in its organizing geometry and Claudian in its specificity of place, this is the landscape not of Arcadia but of France as Gleizes wished it to be.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;David Cottington&quot; /&gt; Gleizes' formal innovations seen in this work are more closely related to the Salon Cubists ([[Jean Metzinger]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]] and [[Fernand Léger]]) than to those of the Gallery Cubists ([[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]]).

The gestures of the bathers in the 'foreground' and the whirls of chimney-smoke in the 'background' are unified expressively through &quot;a timeless and purportedly natural order.&quot; While the subject was &quot;explicit in its reference to latinist classicism&quot; writes Cottington, &quot;and implicit in its rejection of the avant-gardist challenge of the [[Futurism|futurists]] to avoid the pictorial representation of the nude as inescapably ''passé&quot;'', he continues, &quot;the presence of emblems of industrialization, not juxtaposed but integrated with the rhythms of the landscape, marked a definite, if tentative, departure from the concerns he had shared with Le Fauconnier.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;David Cottington&quot; /&gt; Gleizes made use of fragmentation of form, multiple perspective views (i.e., mobile and dynamic, rather than static and from one point-of-view) along with linear and planar structural qualities. Though highly sophisticated in theory, this aspect of [[simultaneity]] would actually become quite commonly employed within the practices of the [[Section d'Or]] group. Gleizes deployed these techniques in ''&quot;a radical, personal and coherent manner&quot;'' (Cottington, 1998).&lt;ref name=&quot;David Cottington&quot; /&gt;

==1912==
[[Image:Recoveredgleizes.jpg|thumb|left|Albert Gleizes, 1911, ''Le Chemin, Paysage à Meudon, Paysage avec personnage'', oil on canvas, 146.4 x 114.4 cm. Exhibited at Salon des Indépendants, Paris, 1911, Salon des Indépendants, Brussels, 1911, Galeria J. Dalmau, Barcelona, 1912, Galerie La Boétie, Salon de La Section d'Or, 1912, stolen by Nazi occupiers from the home of collector Alphonse Kann during World War II, returned to its rightful owners in 1997]]
For Gleizes and those of his entourage 1912 signified a climax in the debates centering around [[modernism]] and [[classicism]] – [[Henri Bergson|Bergson]] and [[Nietzsche]] – [[Euclid]] and [[Riemann]] – [[nationalism]] and [[Regionalism (politics)|regionalism]] – [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]] and [[four-dimensional space]]. It was precisely during 1912 that Gleizes and Metzinger would write the seminal treatise ''[[Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;]]'' (Cubism's only manifesto),&lt;ref name=&quot;David Cottington&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger, ''Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;'', published by Eugène Figuière, Paris, 1912, translated to English and Russian in 1913]&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt &quot;to put a little order into the chaos of everything that had been written in the papers and reviews since 1911&quot;, to use the words of Gleizes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brooke, P.&quot;&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/gltexts/epic Albert Gleizes, 1925, ''The Epic, From immobile form to mobile form''], published in German, 1928, under the title ''Kubismus'', the French version was published as ''L'Epopée (The Epic)'', in the journal ''Le Rouge et le Noir'', 1929. Translation by Peter Brooke&lt;/ref&gt;

It was both as artists and theorists (in painting and writing) that Gleizes and Metzinger expressed their critical and ideological discourse about the possible meanings and significance of [[Cubism]] and contemporary aesthetics. Indeed, ''Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;'' was much more than an unorthodox or anti-academic explanation of the avant-gardist innovations seen in Cubist paintings.

It was natural that Gleizes and Metzinger, both articulate men, should come not just to theorize on the meaning of Cubism, but to defend the movement against attacks leveled in the wake of the 1911 public exhibitions. The two had exhibited regularly at the important salons ([[Salon d'Automne]] and [[Société des Artistes Indépendants|Salon des Indépendants]]) since around 1903 and held divers official positions within them (e.g., hanging committee members). Both were well-versed in philosophy, mathematics and poetry. While Metzinger had participated in discussions at the [[Bateau Lavoir]] (from 1907), both he and Gleizes were largely responsible for the impression made by the Cubists on the general public during both the Salon des Indépendants and Salon d'Automne of 1910 and 1911 respectively. Intellectual and moral support for their endeavors came from members of the [[Section d'Or]] (Groupe de Puteaux).&lt;ref name=&quot;Herschel Browning Chipp&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UZ4Gu7a7V9UC&amp;pg=PA213&amp;lpg=PA213&amp;dq=%22discern+and+that+which+pre-exists+within+us%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=F-vrNN6wHd&amp;sig=ULAMPMqjUeA5We6bwoHDI-Rkfyc&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22discern%20and%20that%20which%20pre-exists%20within%20us%22&amp;f=false Herschel Browning Chipp, with contributions by Peter Howard Selz and Joshua C. Taylor, ''Theories of Modern Art: A Source Book by Artists and Critics'', University of California Press, 1968] {{ISBN|0-520-01450-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, Picasso and Braque remained unknown to the general public and made no recorded statements during the crucial pre-War period. Braque's first brief aphoristic statement regarding Cubism was written in 1917 during his gradual return to health following a head-wound during the war. Picasso's first recorded statement on Cubism is dated 1923, at a time when [[Dada]], [[Surrealism]] and [[Abstract art]] had become fashionable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herschel Browning Chipp&quot; /&gt;

By 1912 art had become much more than a dialogue between ''artist'' and ''nature''. &quot;The three dimensions of sensorial volume&quot;, Gleizes would write in 1925, &quot;left open the field for the introduction of the time factor&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Albert Gleizes&quot;&gt;Albert Gleizes, ''&quot;Cubisme&quot;, Vers une conscience plastique, Essai de généralisation'', 1925, in Bulletin de l'Effort Moderne, 22–32, February 1926–Feb 1927. Also published in ''La Vie des Lettres et des Arts'', May 1925 (written as part of the Bauhaus book, ''Kubismus''). See too Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes: For and Against the Twentieth Century'', 2001, {{ISBN|0-300-08964-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;The diversity of the relations of line to line must be indefinite;&quot; write Gleizes and Metzinger, &quot;on this condition it incorporates quality, the incommensurable sum of the affinities perceived between that which we discern and that which pre-exists within us: on this condition a work of art is able to move us&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herschel Browning Chipp&quot; /&gt;

==Cézanne==

Cézanne, progressively leading up to 1906, moved away from classic pictorial arrangements, single view perspectives, and outlines that enclosed color. His attempt was to arrive at a &quot;lived perspective&quot; by capturing all the complexities that could be observed with the eye and captured by the senses, where both &quot;sight&quot; and &quot;touch&quot; became one. Cèzanne believed his paintings could capture a moment in time, that once passed it was gone, that art and nature are the same. Cèzanne claimed: &quot;Art is a personal apperception, which I embody in sensations and which I ask the understanding to organize into a painting.&quot; The true meaning of painting grew closer as the distance from tradition increased. Just as the Cubists he would inspire, Cèzanne had little interest in the rational naturalistic painting and classical geometrical perspective inherited from the Renaissance. &quot;Nor was he satisfied,&quot; writes Merleau-Ponty, &quot;with the attempts of the Impressionists to dissolve this objective order into its original elements of light and atmosphere&quot;.[sic]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=odF1-rgcyRsC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=%22Art+is+a+personal+apperception,+which+I+embody+in+sensations%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JQcyvfr0PD&amp;sig=4MeurqRfE5fTl03Rajq6o-z3_3w&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Art%20is%20a%20personal%20apperception%2C%20which%20I%20embody%20in%20sensations%22&amp;f=false Maurice Merleau-Ponty, ''Sense and Non-sense''], Northwestern University Studies in Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy, Northwestern University Press, IL, 1964.

==Staticity and dynamism==
[[File:Paul Cézanne 004.jpg|thumb|left|[[Paul Cézanne]], ''Bathers'', 1874–1875, oil on canvas, 38.1 × 46 cm (15 × 18.1 in), [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York City]]
The preoccupations of Gleizes, to considerable extent beyond those emancipated by Cézanne, was to play with the mobile, dynamic, changing aspects of the same form relative to the position of the painter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Albert Gleizes&quot; /&gt;

''Les Baigneuses'', along with other compositions by Gleizes and his fellow Salon Cubists from this period (1911-1912), tend to coordinate a variety of views of the same subject, or a [[Multiplicity (philosophy)|multiplicity]] (in the [[Henri Bergson|Bergsonian]] sense) of different angles in one picture. This attempt clearly shows the importance of both the ''time'' element and the ''mobile'' properties in the sequence of events. According to Gleizes, the artist would accommodate either several successive moments in time projected onto a single space, or multiple spaces projected onto the canvas at the same time. These [[kinematic]] compositions that took into account both staticity and dynamism were not just a new description of the external world created by the artist, but also the inner world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Albert Gleizes&quot; /&gt;

Paintings of the Renaissance could not entirely convey these aspects of the world since their subjects were immobilized in a depiction based on one unique point of view; but the real world better corresponds to multiplicity of vision (we have two eyes). And here is precisely where an ambiguity or uncertainty arises as regards interpretation. This period was in fact marked by the unification of disparate concepts. Classical perspective and non-Euclidean geometry were not, after all, incompatible with one another. [[File:Albert Gleizes, 1912, Les Baigneuses, oil on canvas, 105 x 171 cm, Paris, Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Albert Gleizes, 1912, ''Les Baigneuses'']]
[[File:Eadweard Muybridge, Plate 187 – Dancing, fancy, no. 12, Miss Larrigan.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Eadweard Muybridge]], 1887, ''Animal Locomotion'', Plate 187, Dancing, fancy, no. 12, Miss Larrigan]]
[[File:Nude woman washing face, animated from Animal locomotion, Vol. IV, Plate 413 by Eadweard Muybridge.gif|thumb|right|130px|[[Eadweard Muybridge]], 1887, ''Animal locomotion''. Plate 413, Woman washing, Collotypes; Motion study photographs]] The former was simply viewed as a special case contained within a more general concept. Reconciliation between the static classical and modern mobile approach was attainable since within the representation of successive states of an event could be found repeated images fixed for all time (as in the overlapping of several static images). Just as the dynamism of a ''motion picture'' results from a succession of still shots, the Cubists stance expounded by Gleizes and Metzinger on theoretical and plastic fronts, consisted of capturing the subject matter or object in a series of 'still shots' (static images) and suturing them together (i.e., several successive moments in time projected onto a single space). Likewise, or alternatively, the artist could depict (multiple spaces projected onto the canvas simultaneously).&lt;ref name=&quot;Albert Gleizes&quot; /&gt;

There is a subtle difference or distinction between these two types of simultaneity Gleizes describes that deserve closer attention: inscribed onto the canvas could be either (1) the [[properties]] of two or more [[Event (philosophy)|instantiations]] or [[Event (relativity)|physical occurrence]] happening at the same [[time]] from the point of view of one [[frame of reference]] (the artist fixed in one position), or (2) the artist could inscribe (paint) the properties of one event represented over a succession of time intervals, observed from several frame of reference (or multiple points of view simultaneously expressed onto the canvas), meaning that the observational reference frame is tied to the state of motion of an observer. There are shared variables between the two concepts, involving the flow of time, i.e., temporal in nature, and involving motion (on the part of either the artist or subject), spatial in nature.

This ''cinématique'' nomenclature offered to the spectator several views of an isolated event, of the same subject, or similarly, several different subjects, a series of events, observed from one point of view. No longer was the artist restricted to a principle (or set of principles). The liberation from academicism offered by Cubism, as instigated by [[Cézanne]], resulted from the fact that the artist was no longer restricted to the representation of the subject (or the world) as seen in a photograph. No longer restricted to the imitative description of nature, and despite the complexification of visual stimuli (many views instead of one), the technique of painting became simple and direct.&lt;ref name=&quot;Albert Gleizes&quot; /&gt;

In 1912 the photographic motion studies of [[Eadweard Muybridge]] and [[Étienne-Jules Marey]] particularly interested artists of the [[Section d'Or]], including Jean Metzinger, [[Marcel Duchamp]] and Albert Gleizes. A predecessor to cinematography and moving film, [[chronophotography]] involved a series or succession of different images, originally created and used for the scientific study of movement. These chronophotographs included a series of dancers and women washing. Though Gleizes may not have seen these specific photographs he was likely interested in the same idea, as were the [[Futurism|Futurist]]s. The motion picture with its cinematic techniques was developing too at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warholstars.org/abstractexpressionism/artists/duchamp/marcelduchamp.html Katherine Kuh, ''Marcel Duchamp'', interview broadcast on the BBC program 'Monitor', 29 March 1961, published in Katherine Kuh (ed.), ''The Artist's Voice. Talks with Seventeen '', Harper &amp; Row, New York 1962, pp. 81-93]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Co7ipk-yOs0C&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=Muybridge,+cubism&amp;hl=en&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Muybridge%2C%20cubism&amp;f=false Stephen Kern, The Culture of Time and Space, 1880-1918: With a New Preface'', Harvard University Press, Nov 30, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jay, Bill, ''Eadweard Muybridge, The Man Who Invented Moving Pictures'', Little, Brown, and Company, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a ''scientifique'' nomenclature offered to the spectator (the [[relativity of simultaneity]]), that artists themselves, art critics and art historians have not failed to notice. Some have attempted to refute such connections and others have embraced them. Though the name [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] was not yet a household word in 1912, there has been a rapprochement of the concept of multiplicity described above and the concept of relativity in the Einsteinian sense. While, as Einstein writes, the physicist can generally limit herself to one system of coordinates for the description of physical reality, the Cubist (particularly Gleizes and Metzinger) attempted to show the simultaneity of several such views, or, at the very least, they were unwilling to commit themselves to a single coordinate system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/1578661 Paul M.

==Salon des Indépendants, 1912==
At the 1912 [[Société des Artistes Indépendants|Salon des Indépendants]] Albert Gleizes exhibited ''Les Baigneuses'' (no. 1347) — [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s ''Nu descendant l'escalier'' was listed in the catalogue (n. 1001)&lt;ref&gt;[http://aulivrebleu.unblog.fr/page/2/ Hommage à Marcel Duchamp, Boîte-en-catalogue, 1912-2012, Salon des Indépendants, 1912, n. 1001 of the catalogue, Marcel Duchamp, ''Nu descendant l’escalier'']&lt;/ref&gt; but was supposedly withdrawn — [[Roger de La Fresnaye]] exhibited ''Artillerie'' (no. 1235) — [[Robert Delaunay]] showed his monumental ''Ville de Paris'' (no. 868) — [[Jean Metzinger]] exhibited ''[[La Femme au Cheval|La Femme au Cheval (Woman with a horse)]]'' and ''Le Port'' — [[Fernand Léger]] showed ''La Noce'' — [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], ''Le Chasseur (The Huntsman)'' — and the newcomer [[Juan Gris]] exhibited his ''Portrait of Picasso''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kubisme.info/kt323.html Salon des Indépendants, 1912, kubisme.info]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Joyeux-Prunel&quot;&gt;[http://histoiremesure.revues.org/2333?lang=en Béatrice Joyeux-Prunel, Histoire &amp; Mesure, no.

The art critic Olivier-Hourcade writes of this exhibition in 1912 and its relation to the creation of a new French school: 'Metzinger with his ''Port'', Delaunay with ''Paris'', Gleizes with his ''Baigneuses, are close to this real and magnificent result, this victory comes from several centuries: the creation of a school of painting, 'French' and absolutely independent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joyeux-Prunel&quot; /&gt;

Gleizes' ''[[Portrait de l’éditeur Eugène Figuière (Gleizes)|Portrait de Eugène Figuière]]'', ''[[La Chasse (painting)|La Chasse (The Hunt)]]'', and ''Les Baigneuses'' are seen towards the center]]
Gleizes, on the other hand, would write the following year (1913) of the movements continual evolution:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The changes it had already undergone since the Indépendants of 1911 could leave people in no doubt as to its nature. Cubism was not a school, distinguished by some superficial variation on a generally accepted norm. It was a total regeneration, indicating the emergence of a wholly new cast of mind. Every season it appeared renewed, growing like a living body. Its enemies could, eventually, have forgiven it if only it had passed away, like a fashion; but they became even more violent when they realised that it was destined to live a life that would be longer than that of those painters who had been the first to assume the responsibility for it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brooke, P.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&quot;Never had a crowd been seen thrown into such a turmoil by works of the spirit, and especially over esemplastic works, paintings, whose nature it is to be silent&quot;, writes Albert Gleizes, &quot;Never had the critics been so violent as they were at that time. From which it became clear that these paintings—and I specify the names of the painters who were, alone, the reluctant causes of all this frenzy: Jean Metzinger, Henri Le Fauconnier, Fernand Léger, Robert Delaunay and myself—appeared as a threat to an order that everyone thought had been established forever.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brooke, P.&quot; /&gt;

'''''Le Dépiquage des Moissons''''', also known as '''''Harvest Threshing''''', and '''''The Harvesters''''', is an immense oil painting created in 1912 by the French artist, theorist and writer [[Albert Gleizes]] (1881–1953). It was first revealed to the general public at the Salon de la [[Section d'Or]], ''Galerie La Boétie'' in Paris, October 1912 (no. 43). This work, along with ''La Ville de Paris'' (''City of Paris'') by [[Robert Delaunay]], is the largest and most ambitious [[Cubism|Cubist]] painting undertaken during the pre-War Cubist period. Formerly in the collection of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, this monumental painting by Gleizes is exhibited at the National Museum of Western Art, in Tokyo, Japan.

==Description==
The work is an oil painting on canvas with dimensions 269 x 353&amp;nbsp;cm (106 x 138 in), signed and dated lower right, Gleizes, 1912. &quot;''Harvest Threshing''&quot;, wrote curator and art historian [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]] for the Gleizes Guggenheim Retrospective in 1964, &quot;summarizes Gleizes' interest in presenting an epic panorama of mountains, valleys, clouds and smoke, towns, workers and wheat, a simultaneous celebration of the harvest, nature and man in idealistic harmony.&quot; Gleizes' painting, as [[Henri Le Fauconnier]]'s ''Abundance'', likely takes its theme from the social and synthetic program of the [[Abbaye de Créteil]], and too, from the poem of [[:fr:Henri-Martin Barzun|Henri-Martin Barzun]], ''La Montagne, Poèmes légendaires'', part 5 of ''La Terrestre Tragedie'' (Paris, Mercure de France, 1908): ''Les Moissonneurs dans les Epis, armes de faux et de faucilles...'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;49–56).&lt;ref name=&quot;Daniel Robbins&quot;&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/albertgleizes1881robb#page/n3/mode/2up Daniel Robbins, 1964, ''Albert Gleizes 1881 - 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition'', Published by The Solomon R.

While the [[still-life]] and [[nude]] are common themes of pre-[[World War I]] Cubism, the work of Gleizes is characterized by ambitious subjects:&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter Brooke 2012&quot;&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a%26r/Du%20Cubisme/contents Peter Brooke, ''On &quot;Cubism&quot; in context'', 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; the harvest, the hunt, the city, and, later, ''Broadway'' in New York City, and the ''Brooklyn Bridge'' (1915, Guggenheim, New York), one of his most abstract paintings of this period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daniel Robbins, MoMA&quot;&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=2191 Daniel Robbins, MoMA, Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; Gleizes took this, according to Peter Brooke, as symbolic of the need to express the whole vast drama, the collection of unprecedented sensations of modern life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter Brooke 2012&quot; /&gt;
''Harvest Threshing'' represents a big subject, rich in plastic possibilities. The interest of the painting resides in its rich and complex fabric of interwoven latticework, with 'the institution of relations between straight lines and curves' or the 'thousand surprises of fire and of shadow' proposed in ''[[Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;]]'' (co-authored with [[Jean Metzinger]] in 1912). The subject matter is entirely, as Le Fauconnier and Gleizes himself says, 'a pretext'. A pencil transcription done to scale by Geneviève Dalban, as Peter Brooke points out, reveals the greatness of the construction. &quot;The 'duration' that has been so much talked about is entirely a matter of the length of time that can be spent looking at it, as one thing leads to another, in and out and round about, in an endless visual dance. It is a mark of the failure of the Cubist revolution – its hi-jacking by the champions of the subject – that nearly one hundred years later there are writers on art who can see in such a picture only peasants, a church tower, a rustic meal, mountains, clouds...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter Brooke 2012&quot; /&gt;

In this painting can be observed the summing up of all present in the art of [[Georges Seurat]]: &quot;the line, independent of its topographical role, possesses an assessable abstract value&quot;, it represented the furthest extension of [[Paul Cézanne]]'s preoccupations: his will to deconstruct, his revolt against imitation and refusal of Renaissance perspective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://Cubism-coldcreation.blogspot.com Alex Mittelmannn, ''State of the Modern Art World, The Essence of Cubism and its Evolution in Time'', 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

Much as that of ''[[Les Baigneuses (Gleizes)|Les Baigneuses]]'' and ''[[Man on a Balcony (Gleizes)|Man on a Balcony (Portrait of Dr. Théo Morinaud)]]'' painted the same year, the subject matter of ''Harvest Threshing''—a semi-urban landscape that possesses both rural and semi-industrial components, juxtaposing sharply contrasting elements of both traditional and modern life—is derived from an unsentimental observation of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter Brooke 2012&quot; /&gt; On the one hand the artist makes illusion to the traditional process of [[threshing]]—a step in grain preparation after [[harvest]]ing and before [[winnowing]], now mostly done by machine—and on the other, the artist includes elements from a society in the process of inexorable industrialization. Yet the compositional relationships between the two are formally resolved. The representation of this transition between classical tradition and contemporary life was noticeably of interest to Gleizes, as it was to other artists of the [[Section d'Or]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Daniel Robbins&quot; /&gt;

&quot;The organic process of life and civilization, moving irresistibly toward harmonious interaction,&quot; wrote [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Robbins]], &quot;was the subject of Gleizes' art.&quot; It was treated neither as a &quot;confined symbolic allegory nor as a cultural background indicated by specific real appearance, but was instead presented in concrete and precise terms. Gleizes' ''Harvest Threshing'', the masterpiece of the Section d'Or (no. 34), is not merely an anecdote in a scene. Rather, it is a multiple panorama celebrating the worker, his material life and his collective activity in securing that life on a permanently changing land. Gleizes confronts us not with one action or place, but with many: not with one time, but with past and future as well as present.&quot;(Robbins, 1964)&lt;ref name=&quot;Daniel Robbins&quot; /&gt;

==In contrast to Picasso and Braque==
[[File:Braque fruitdish glass.jpg|thumb|left|130px|[[Georges Braque]], ''Fruitdish and Glass'', [[papier collé]] and charcoal on paper, 1912]]
[[File:L'Aveyron, Decazeville, 1918, Les Usines, CPA.jpg|thumb|right|L'Aveyron, Decazeville, 1918, Les Usines, postcard]]
Gleizes had no intention of analyzing and describing neutral objects from daily life; a bowl of fruit, a pipe, violin or guitar. His 'empathetic' consciousness and complex idealistic concepts of the world led him to portray—rather than 'mundane' objects—subjects of vast proportion, of provocative social and cultural significance. For Gleizes, consciousness and reality could meet and reconcile on the surface of the canvas. There is no period that corresponds closely to the analytic Cubism developed by Picasso and Braque in the work of Gleizes, as of Delaunay, Le Fauconnier and [[Fernand Léger|Léger]]. The ''iconography'' of these artists, in contrast to that of Picasso and Braque, helps elucidate the reasons. At the same time, iconography explains how Gleizes and Delaunay were to become abstract painters, theoretically closer to  [[Wassily Kandinsky]] and [[Piet Mondrian]] than to Picasso, Braque or even [[Juan Gris|Gris]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Daniel Robbins&quot; /&gt;

The intention of Gleizes had been to reconstitute and synthesize the real-world according to his own consciousness. Important factors in this process were the relationships and interactions between volumes to convey solidity, structure, weight, placement. Also important was a principal lessons of Cézanne: the indivisibility of form and color; a change in one would alter the other.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daniel Robbins&quot; /&gt;

Unlike Picasso and Braque, the work of Gleizes always involved the synthetic treatment of broad subjects, each section of canvas receiving equal attention. As a consequence, almost a year after the completion of ''The Harvesters'', Gleizes would develop compositional innovations: broad tilting planes that provide a transition from the outer rectangles to the rotating forms at the core of the work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daniel Robbins&quot; /&gt;

Gleizes was aware of the differences between his own interests and those of Picasso and Braque. He wrote an article after seeing Picasso's work for the first time (in 1911). After quoting Apollinaire about returning to the principles of structure, color and inspiration, he wrote that the &quot;valuable [precieuses] indications of Picasso and Braque, in spite of everything, did not depart from an impressionism of form which, nevertheless, they opposed (an impressionism of) color.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Daniel Robbins&quot; /&gt;

==Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;==
[[Image:Albert Gleizes, l'Homme au Balcon, 1912, oil on canvas, 195.6 x 114.9 cm, Philadelphia Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|150px|Albert Gleizes, 1912, ''[[Man on a Balcony (Gleizes)|l'Homme au Balcon, Man on a Balcony (Portrait of Dr. Théo Morinaud)]]'', oil on canvas, 195.6 x 114.9 cm (77 x 45 1/4 in.), [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]. Exhibited at Salon d'Automne, Paris, 1912, [[Armory show]], New York, Chicago, Boston, 1913. The setting: an urban backdrop of bridge-girders, smokestacks and train tracks viewed from the balcony of a surgeon's office, avenue de l'Opéra, Paris]]
In preparation for the Salon de la Section d'Or, and in the wake of their controversial showing at the Salon des Indépendants in the spring of 1911, Albert Gleizes and [[Jean Metzinger]] published a major defense of Cubism and the first theoretical essay on the new movement, entitled ''[[Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;]]''.

Passages of their text which attempted to reconcile goals and methods of modern painting were read to the circle around the Duchamp brothers (the Puteaux group) during the summer of 1912 and it was published before the conclusion of the Salon de la Section d’Or, where Gleizes exhibited his monumental Cubist painting ''The Harvesters''. Gleizes believed that artists could explain themselves in writing as well as (or better than) critics. He continued writing throughout the following years as ''Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;'' enjoyed wide circulation within a continuously growing circle of artists and connoisseurs. By placing the artist at the centre of society, Albert Gleizes, along with a generation of painters from diverse classes and nations, helped revolutionize the bourgeois canons. By observing and thinking, as opposed to serving solely as an ornamenter, Gleizes concluded, the artist realized a fundamental service to humanity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daniel Robbins, MoMA&quot;/&gt;

Shortly after the 1912 publication of ''[[Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;]]'', Guillaume Apollinaire published ''Les Peintres Cubiste'' (1913, written in 1912), in which he wrote &quot;Majesty: this is what, above all, characterizes the art of Albert Gleizes. [...] This majesty arouses and provokes the imagination; considered from the plastic point of view, it is the immensity of things. [...] The pictures of Albert Gleizes are realized by a force of the same sort as that which realized the Pyramids and the Cathedrals, the constructions in metal, the bridges and the tunnels.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Guillaume Apollinaire, ''Aesthetic Meditations on Painting, The Cubist Painters'' (Second Series), written in 1912, published in 1913 (Edition Figuière, Paris), translated and published in [http://dl.lib.brown.edu/mjp/render.php?id=1299781650906252&amp;view=mjp_object ''The Little Review'', Quarterly Journal of art and letters, ''Stella Number'', Autumn 1922, New York, London] (Administration; Margaret Anderson, Francis Picabia and Ezra Pound).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
* Solomon R. Guggenheim (acquired from the artist in 1938)

&lt;blockquote&gt;At the outset of 1938, Gleizes learned that the religious community that owned Moly Sabata, a large house he had rented in Sablons, was ready to sell. Despite his success at the 1937 [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne]], he lacked the funds necessary to purchase the house. In August, however, the American collector, Solomon R. Guggenheim purchased a large number of paintings directly from Gleizes, including his pre-war Cubist masterpiece, ''Le Dépiquage des Moissons''; a work he hoped would have been taken by a museum in France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a%26r/a%26rintro Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1881-1953'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Passy, Bridges of Paris''''', also called '''''Les ponts de Paris (Passy)''''', or '''''Paysage à Passy''''', is a painting created in 1912 by the French artist, theorist and writer [[Albert Gleizes]]. The work was exhibited at the Salon de la [[Société Normande de Peinture Moderne]], Rouen, 1912 (titled ''Passy''); the Salon de la [[Section d'Or]], Galerie La Boétie, Paris, 1912 (titled ''Passy''); Manes Moderni Umeni, Vystava, Prague, 1914 (titled ''Paysage à Passy''); and Galerie [[Der Sturm]], Berlin, July, 1914.

''Passy'' was one of a small group of works chosen to be reproduced in the seminal treatise ''[[Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;]]'', written by Albert Gleizes and [[Jean Metzinger]] in 1912 and published by Eugène Figuière the same year. Executed in a highly personal [[Cubism|Cubist]] style with multiple viewpoints and planar faceting, this is one of a number of paintings from 1912-13 involving the theme of the bridge in an urban landscape.

In opposition to classical perspective as a mode of representation, Gleizes employed a new spatial model based in part on the pictorial space of the mathematician [[Jules Henri Poincaré|Henri Poincaré]].

This painting, in the collection of the Museum Moderner Kunst ([[mumok]]),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mumok.at/en/les-ponts-de-paris-passy Museum Moderner Kunst (mumok), Albert Gleizes, Les Ponts de Paris (Passy)]&lt;/ref&gt; Vienna, probably refers to the spirit of solidarity among the newly formed &quot;Artists of Passy&quot;, during a time when factions had begun to develop within [[Cubism]].

==Description==
''Passy (Bridges of Paris)'' is an oil painting on canvas with dimensions 60.5 x 73.2&amp;nbsp;cm (23.8 by 28.8 inches), signed and dated ''Alb Gleizes, 1914'', lower left.

In the foreground, the former [[Champ de Mars]] train station, followed by the [[Pont de Bir-Hakeim|Pont de Passy]]. Postcard image taken from the 2nd level of the Eiffel Tower]]
The works represents an upscale ''cartier de Paris'' known as Passy located in the [[16th arrondissement of Paris]], one of the most wealthy districts of the French capital, and traditionally the home of well-known personalities, including [[Honoré de Balzac]], [[Benjamin Franklin]] during the nine years that he lived in France, [[William Kissam Vanderbilt]], and the artist [[Jacques-Emile Blanche]].

''Les Artistes de Passy'' was a divers grouping of [[avant-garde]] artistes (painters, sculptors and poets), including several who previously held meetings in 1910 at the rue Visconti studio of Henri Le Fauconnier. Their first diner (''Premier dîner des Artistes de Passy'') presided over by [[Paul Fort]] was held at the [[Maison de Balzac|house of Balzac]], rue Raynouard, in the presence of [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]], [[Marie Laurencin]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[André Mare]], [[Francis Picabia]], Henry Valensi, and [[Jacques Villon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.larousse.fr/archives/grande-encyclopedie/page/3910 ''Cubisme, 1912&quot;, Archives, Grande Encyclopédie Larousse]&lt;/ref&gt; Albert Gleizes chose to Passy as the subject of this painting.

Instead of depicting a bowl of fruit or a man playing a guitar under the influence of African art, Gleizes turns toward a [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean]] model of geometry as a source of inspiration for ''Passy''. This work signified the rejection of [[Euclidean geometry]] and its correlate; the quantitative measurement of spatial depth governing [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] invented during the Renaissance, an unquestioned principle of academic painting that had persisted to date.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mittelmann&quot;&gt;[http://cubism-coldcreation.blogspot.com/ Alex Mittelmann, ''State of the Modern Art World, The Essence of Cubism and its Evolution in Time'', 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

Vanishing points have been abolished. A perspectival grid is gone. Forms are not clearly delineated. Colors are synthetic and limited, not overpowering. Light and reflected light do not come from a consistent unidirectional source. There is no precisely clear relationship between structures (e.g., buildings, bridges) based on overlapping or on diminished scale with distance to show [[depth of field]] as objects recede from the foreground. Here Gleizes brakes all the rules. Perhaps for this reason ''Passy'' was chosen as an example of ''new painting'' for publication in their manifesto; ''[[Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Antliff and Leighten&quot;&gt;Mark Antliff, Patricia Dee Leighten, ''Cubism and Culture'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 2001, Albert Gleizes, ''Passy (Ponts de Paris)'', reproduced Fig. 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brooke, Gleizes&quot;&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a%26r/a%26rintro Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1881-1953'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Antliff and Leighten write of ''Passy (Ponts de Paris)'' in ''Cubism and Culture'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Instead of this [academic] spatial model, Cubists turned to new models of geometry and the 'fourth dimension' as inspiration for the works like Gleizes's ''Passy'' (Ponts de Paris) of 1912, which he and Metzinger reproduced in their tract ''Du Cubisme'' as exemplary of art expressing their ideas. This urban landscape synthesized the river, trees, clouds, buildings, steel bridges and smoke of the modern city. Partially geometrized forms—such as the green arc of tree on the upper left or arched doors and windows on the rectangular buildings in the center—are subjectively evoked through limited colour range; shifting perspectives, signified by long vertical and diagonal bands cutting off the edges of objects contained within them; and shifting relative scales of objects, such as the two steel bridge spans. [...] the Cubists justified this novel approach to pictorial space in part on the basis of the mathematician [[Jules Henri Poincaré|Henri Poincaré]]'s theory of 'conventionalism'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Antliff and Leighten&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The existence of a fourth dimension, according to Poincaré, could not be ruled out by observation alone. &quot;If the number of dimensions comes from the way in which we are made&quot;, Poincaré hypothesized, &quot;there might be thinking beings living in our world, but made differently from us, who would think that space has more or less than three dimensions.&quot;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus the characteristic property of space, that of having three dimensions, is only a property of our distribution board, a property residing, so to speak, in the human intelligence. The destruction of some of these connections that is to say of these associations of ideas, would be sufficient to give us a different distribution board, and that might be enough to endow space with a fourth dimension. (Poincaré, 1897)&lt;ref name=&quot;Henri Poincaré&quot;&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/fr/poincare.htm Henri Poincaré, ''The Relativity of Space'', from ''Science &amp; Method'', 1897]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Poincaré stressed the importance of understanding the ''relativity of space''. Space is in reality amorphous, according to Poincaré, only things that occupy space give it a form:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One part of space is not by itself and in the absolute sense of the word equal to another part of space, for if it is so for us, it will not be so for the inhabitants of the universe B, and they have precisely as much right to reject our opinion as we have to condemn theirs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

I have shown elsewhere what are the consequences of these facts from the point of view of the idea that we should construct non-Euclidean and other analogous geometries. (Poincaré, 1897)&lt;ref name=&quot;Henri Poincaré&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Consistent with the view of Poincaré, Euclidean geometry represented one configuration among many equally valid geometric models that Gleizes could have chosen. With this newfound liberty, he was free to transform ''Passy'' in accord with his own subjectivity. This radical break from classical conventions was not without its parallel in Nietzschean free will and freedom of expression. In an essay on the Cubism of Metzinger published September 1911, Gleizes wrote of his compatriot as a disciple of the philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] who 'invents his own truth' by destroying 'old values'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Antliff and Leighten&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albert Gleizes, L'Art et ses représentants. ''Jean Metzinger'', Revue Indépendante, Paris, September, 1911, pp.&amp;nbsp;161–172&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the classical Euclidean notion of 'fixed' absolute space explicitly informed the fictive 'moment' of absolute time, the Cubists jettisoned the idea of placing the observer at a privileged spatial position at a fixed moment in time. Now, according to the theoretical deliberations of Gleizes and Metzinger, artists were free to move around the subject matter, depicting multiple views 'simultaneously', whereby several successive moments in time could be captured and projected onto the canvas at once. In the process, the 'total image' produced over a period of time was more complete than a single instantaneous view.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mittelmann&quot; /&gt;

The intervention of memory in the process of representation was an important criterion for Henri Poincaré (as it would be too for the philosopher [[Henri Bergson]], [[Symbolism (arts)|post-Symbolist]] writers and Gleizes himself):

:Besides, we have to make a representation, not of a complexus of simultaneous sensations, but of a complexus of successive sensations, following one another in a determined order, and it is for this reason that I said just now that the intervention of memory is necessary. (Poincaré, 1897)&lt;ref name=&quot;Henri Poincaré&quot; /&gt;

&quot;Absolute space exists no longer&quot; writes Poincaré; &quot;there is only space relative to a certain initial position of the body&quot;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;We define a point by the succession of movements we require to make to reach it, starting from a certain initial position of the body. The axes are accordingly attached to this initial position of the body.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

But the position I call initial may be arbitrarily chosen from among all the positions my body has successively occupied. If a more or less unconscious memory of these successive positions is necessary for the genesis of the notion of space, this memory can go back more or less into the past. Hence results a certain indeterminateness in the very definition of space, and it is precisely this indeterminateness which constitutes its relativity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Memory would play an important role in ''Les Ponts de Paris (Passy)'', as it did in Gleizes' ''[[Le Chemin, Paysage à Meudon (Gleizes)|Le Chemin (Paysage à Meudon)]]'', ''[[Portrait of Jacques Nayral (Gleizes)|Portrait of Jacques Nayral]]'', painted in 1911, ''[[Man on a Balcony (Gleizes)|Man on a Balcony]]'' of 1912, and ''[[Portrait de l’éditeur Eugène Figuière (Gleizes)|Portrait de l’éditeur Eugène Figuière]]'', of 1913: Both the content and form in these paintings were the result of mind associations as he completed the works from ''memory''; something that would play a crucial role in the works of other Cubists, such as [[Fernand Léger]], [[Robert Delaunay]] and [[Francis Picabia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Antliff and Leighten&quot; /&gt;

==Cubist factions==
Disparate inspirations during a [[Proto-Cubism|proto-Cubist]] phase had already yielded several related methods of expressing the geometric experience (what Gleizes and Metzinger would soon attribute to ''mobile perspective''). Cubism was in the eye of the beholder; it could be seen as a process, a system, a state of mind, an inspired attitude that would develop a new symbolic structure, a reflection of the changing world.

Despite their similarities, works produced by divers artists were neither homogeneous nor isotropic. This venture was essentially nonlinear. Cubism was omnidirectional, growing like a tree with many branches. The progression of each artist was unique. Even when paths would cross, artists would not necessarily fall under one another's influence. Despite a growing awareness, a 'collective consciousness' based on a nonacademic passion for structure and mobility, and despite the sense of group unity that would attain a maxima circa 1912, deep-seated differences arose sporadically, often fueled by critics and dealers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mittelmann&quot; /&gt;

In ''Albert Gleizes, 1881-1953, A Retrospective Exhibition'', Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum curator and art historian [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]] writes of ''Passy'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;A synthesis of the modern city with its smoke, river and steel bridges, this work probably refers also to the spirit of solidarity among the newly formed &quot;Artists of Passy&quot;. In this sense it indicates an awareness of factions within Cubism. (Robbins, 1964)&lt;ref name=&quot;Daniel Robbins, 1964&quot;&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/albertgleizes1881robb#page/n3/mode/2up Daniel Robbins, 1964, ''Albert Gleizes 1881 – 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition'', Published by The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, in collaboration with Musée National d'Art Moderne, Paris, Museum am Ostwall, Dortmund]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The participation of many artists, in addition to Metzinger, Gleizes and the Duchamp brothers, in the formation of the association ''Les Artistes de Passy'' in October 1912 was an attempt to transform the Passy district of Paris into yet another art-centre; a further sign of a growing emphasis on communal activity that would culminate in the [[Section d'Or]] exhibition.&lt;ref name=&quot;The History and Chronology of Cubism&quot;&gt;[http://www.serdar-hizli-art.com/art_history/abstract_art/history_and_chronology_of_cubism_page_5.htm The History and Chronology of Cubism, p. 5]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Les Artistes de Passy'' was a further sign too, as Robbins points out, of the growing rift that separated the Salon Cubists (Metzinger, Gleizes, Le Fauconnier, Delaunay, Léger and others) from the Gallery Cubists (Picasso and Braque). There was a distinct difference between the Salon Cubists and [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler|Kahnweiler]]’s Cubists. The latter had mostly been seen by a small group of artists and connoisseurs in a small private gallery, generating only modest reviews in the press, while the impact of the Salon group in the printed press and general public was enormous. Kahnweiler had exclusivity contracts with his artists and sold only to a small circle of collectors from his small &quot;boutique&quot; (Gleizes' term) comparatively hidden behind [[La Madeleine, Paris|La Madeleine]]. Works of the Salon Cubists were seen by tens of thousands of spectators during well-publicized, conspicuous and prominent events such as the [[Salon d'Automne]] and [[Salon des Indépendants]]. Picasso and Barque were kept away from the Salons by Kahnweiler for fear of ridicule and for financial reasons (exclusivity guaranteed commission).&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor&quot;&gt;[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/51056.html Michael Taylor, 2010, Philadelphia Museum of Art, ''Tea Time (Woman with a Teaspoon)'', 1 Audio Stop 439, Podcast]&lt;/ref&gt;

:Metzinger's ''[[Le goûter (Tea Time)]]'' &quot;was far more famous than any painting that Picasso and Braque had made up until this time; because Picasso and Braque, by not showing at the Salons, have actually removed themselves from the public... For most people, the idea of Cubism was actually associated with an artist like Metzinger, far more than Picasso.&quot; (Michael Taylor, 2010, Curator Philadelphia Museum of Art)&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor&quot; /&gt;

This painting from the collection of [[Wilhelm Uhde]] was confiscated by the French state and sold at the Hôtel Drouot in 1921]]
While financial support from Kahnweiler's gallery sales gave Picasso and Braque the freedom to experiment in relative privacy,&lt;ref name=&quot;Christopher Green&quot;&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;displayall=1#skipToContent Christopher Green, 2009, Cubism, MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; the highly publicized Salon Cubists were free to experiment in public and sell works directly from their studios and Salons.

The immense Cubist manifestation called ''Salon de la Section d'Or'' of 1912 (an exhibition organized by Metzinger, Gleizes and the Duchamp brothers) took place at the centrally located ''Galerie de la Boétie'' in a prominent gallery district of Paris. This gallery showing by Salon Cubists may have been seen as a threat by Kahnweiler, since it marked the beginning of decades of personal attacks targeting artists not associated with his gallery.

At stake, beyond commercial speculation and financial profit, were the questions of when Cubism began, who led the way in its development, what distinguishes Cubist art, how it can be defined and who can be called Cubist. By marginalizing the contribution of the artists who exhibited at the Salon des Indépendants and Salon d'Automne, Kahnweiler's attempted to focus attention on Picasso and Braque, those who played a leading if independent role in the development of this new mode of expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christopher Green&quot; /&gt; To some extent Kahnweiler had succeeded in his endeavor, prompting historians such as Douglas Cooper to coin the term ‘true’ Cubism to describe the work of Picasso and Braque. The implied value judgement was intentional.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christopher Green&quot; /&gt;

This restricted view of Cubism has since been replaced by more contemporary alternative interpretations of Cubism, more complex and heteroclite; formed to some degree in response to the more publicized Salon Cubists, whose methods were too distinct from those of the Gallery Cubists to be considered merely secondary to them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brooke, Gleizes&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Christopher Green&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robbins&quot;&gt;Daniel Robbins, Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism, 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, The University of Iowa Museum of Art, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Salon Cubists produced a different kinds of Cubism. It is not clear to what extent these Cubists depended on Picasso and Braque for their development of such techniques as faceting, ‘passage’ and multiple perspective. They could well have arrived at such practices with little knowledge of Picasso and Braque, guided by their own understanding of Cézanne. The works produced by these other Cubists exhibited at the 1911 and 1912 Salons extended beyond the conventional Cézannian range of subjects chosen by Picasso and Braque to include large-scale allegoric and modern-life subjects. &quot;Aimed at a large Salon public&quot;, writes art historian Christopher Green, &quot;these works made clear use of Cubist techniques of faceting and multiple perspective for expressive effect in order to preserve the eloquence of subjects that were richly endowed with literary and philosophical connotations&quot;. The Salon Cubists were attuned to the philosopher [[Henri Bergson]]'s notion of ‘duration’, according to which life is subjectively experienced as a continuous forward movement in time, with the past flowing into the present and the present merging into the future. In ''[[Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;]]'' Gleizes and Metzinger explicitly related this sense of time to ''multiple perspective''. &quot;The one major innovation that one can be sure was made independently by the Salon Cubists, that of ‘simultaneity’, came of a conviction also rooted in their understanding of Bergson that the divisions of space and time should be comprehensively challenged.&quot; Green continues: &quot;The conjunction of such subject-matter with simultaneity aligns Salon Cubism with early [[Futurism|Futurist]] paintings by [[Umberto Boccioni]], [[Gino Severini]] and [[Carlo Carrà]]; these Italian works, though themselves made in response to early Cubism, led the way in the application of techniques of simultaneity in 1911–12&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christopher Green&quot; /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'What is necessary', writes Gleizes, 'is to take everything up again from the foundations and to start out from the unquestionable reality of two currents which, unaware of each other, were finally enfolded under a single heading, the movement that was called 'Cubism'. You can then avoid confusion if, right from the start, you make the distinctions that must, in all honesty, be acknowledged. The history of the 'Bâteau Lavoir' belongs to those who were part of that particular grouping. Personally, I only know what has been said about this history; I do not know the details, nor did my comrades of the other group Metzinger, Delaunay, Le Fauconnier and Léger... But what I do know well, because I lived it and remember it perfectly, is the origin of our relations and their development to 1914, passing by the notorious Room 41 of the ''Indépendants'' of 1911, which provoked the 'involuntary scandal' out of which Cubism really emerged and spread in Paris, in France and through the world... (Albert Gleizes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a%26r/gltexts/picasso Gleizes, on Picasso and Braque (1911-1953), An anthology, Extract No. 1, Albert Gleizes, Les Méjades, to Mme &amp;#91;-&amp;#93;, n.d. &amp;#91;1953&amp;#93;, First published in French, Association des Amis d'Albert Gleizes, 1997], Preface and translation by Peter Brooke&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gleizes continues in an unpublished 1917 paper:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Speculators with their own interests and the idiocy [''sottise''] of painters who played their game created a legend which up to now has never openly been challenged. It proclaimed that the entire movement of plastic art of our time had been thrown into confusion by the discoveries above-mentioned. Their inventor was made into the pivot of the movement which was being built. Everything came from him, he had foreseen everything and outside his genius the rest was nothing but pastiche and followers. The truth, however, is that it was the appearance of a ''group'' that gave the twist of the helm to the new aspirations. It was not the work of an isolated figure who presided over the mystery of a boutique, who surrounded himself with thick veils and acted on some sniffer dogs [''flaireurs''] and dupes, but rather the brutal appearance in broad daylight of a coherent group [''ensemble homogène''] who did not claim to be displaying masterpieces but wanted to witness a fervent discipline, a new order. [...] On one side, the talk was all of the moderns and the negroes, on the other it was of the cathedrals and the solidity [''sureté''] of David and Ingres.

''''' La Promenade''''' is an oil on canvas, early [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] painting by the French artist [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], created in 1870.  The work depicts a young couple on an excursion outside of the city, walking on a path through a [[woodland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;house2&quot;&gt;House, John (1997).

Getty Publications. pp. 1, 14, 53, 55, 81. {{ISBN|9780892363650}}. {{oclc|37109128}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by the [[rococo revival]] style during the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]], Renoir's '' La Promenade'' reflects the older style and themes of eighteenth-century artists like [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard]] and [[Jean-Antoine Watteau]].  The work also shows the influence of [[Claude Monet]] on Renoir's new approach to painting.

==Background==
The forest was a popular landscape subject for nineteenth-century French artists, particularly the [[forest of Fontainebleau]]. Before Renoir, [[Claude Monet]] (1840–1926) painted ''Bazille and Camille (Study for &quot;Déjeuner sur l'Herbe&quot;)'' (1865), showing a couple together in the forest.   In 1869, Renoir and Monet spent time painting together at La Grenouillère. By 1870, Renoir was living in Louveciennes with his mother.&lt;ref name=&quot;house2&quot;/&gt;   Throughout this decade, the eighteenth-century [[rococo]] art movement was back in style and Renoir embraced it.&lt;ref name=&quot;herbert&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;groom&quot;&gt;Groom, Gloria (2001).

A young man, possibly a ''canotier'', boatman, given his distinctive [[boater]] hat, holds the hand of a young woman on a path surrounded by bushes, perhaps on the banks of the Seine, with the implication of an upcoming intimate encounter.&lt;ref name=&quot;house2&quot;/&gt;  The image of lovers walking through a woodland is based on a popular rococo theme.&lt;ref name=&quot;herbert&quot;&gt;Herbert, Robert L. (1988). ''Impressionism: Art, Leisure, and Parisian Society''. Yale University Press. pp. 190–192. {{ISBN|9780300050837}}. {{oclc|16925240}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Interpretations of the figure models vary.  It is generally believed that the model for the woman in ''La Promenade'' was [[Lise Tréhot]], Renoir's favorite model and companion during his early Salon period.&lt;ref name=&quot;tinterow&quot;/&gt;  In the past, it was believed that the man in the painting was landscape painter [[Alfred Sisley]] (1839–1899) and the woman was Rapha, a companion of musician [[Edmond Maître]] (1840–1898).&lt;ref name=&quot;muchnic&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;getty&quot;/&gt;  

The original title of the painting is unknown.  It first received the title ''La Promenade'' by unnamed owners of the work when it was put up for sale in 1898.  It was not until 1941 that questions about the original title came to light.  Renoir was known to strenuously object to sentimental titles applied by others to his work.  &quot;Why have they given names to my pictures which never represent the reason I painted such and such a subject? My joy consists in painting, and it has never been in my mind to paint a preconceived subject&quot;, Renoir said in his later years.&lt;ref&gt;''Renoir Centennial Loan Exhibition'', 1941, as cited in House 1997, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Renoir did exhibit a painting with the title of ''La Promenade'' in 1876, but that work  is now known as ''[[Mother and Children]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;house2&quot;/&gt;

==Critical reception==
In a commentary for the exhibition ''Origins of Impressionism'' (1994–95), [[Henri Loyrette]] writes that ''La Promenade'' &quot;succeeds at last in what Renoir had for so long and so vainly sought: the integration of the figure in a landscape&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;tinterow&quot;&gt;Tinterow, Gary. Henri Loyrette (1994). ''Origins of Impressionism''. Metropolitan Museum of Art. pp. 141, 457. {{ISBN|9780870997174}}. {{oclc|30623473}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Loyrette notes the influence of Monet in ''La Promenade'' and the change in Renoir's style since ''Les Fiancés'' (1868).&lt;ref name=&quot;tinterow&quot;/&gt; The Impressionist influence on Renoir, Perrin Stein writes, led to his increasing use of the [[Analogous colors|high-key palette]].&lt;ref name=&quot;getty&quot;/&gt; Renoir's &quot;lightness and delicacy of touch&quot; here is, according to art historian John House, reminiscent of rococo artist [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard]] (1732–1806).&lt;ref name=&quot;house2&quot;/&gt;  Critics also view the influence of [[Jean-Antoine Watteau]] (1684–1721) on this work, particularly in Renoir's use of the intimate couple in the woods, a motif popularized in scenes found in Watteau's ''[[fête galante]]'' genre.&lt;ref name=&quot;getty&quot;/&gt;

==Other work==
[[File:Auguste Renoir - Lovers - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|200px|''The Lovers'' (1875)]]
In addition to ''La Promenade'', Renoir explored rococo themes in several subsequent works including ''The Lovers'' (1875) and ''Confidences'' (1878).&lt;ref name=&quot;herbert&quot;/&gt; In 1883, Renoir created a drawing titled ''Couple on a Hillside'' for the French literary review ''La Vie Moderne'' based on a variation of ''La Promenade'' a decade earlier, but redesigned to show different angles and positions of the original figures.&lt;ref name=&quot;getty&quot;&gt;J.

'''Landscape painting in Scotland''' includes all forms of [[Landscape art|painting of landscapes]] in Scotland since its origins in the sixteenth century to the present day. The earliest examples of Scottish landscape painting are in the tradition of [[Scottish Renaissance painted ceilings|Scottish house decoration]] that arose in the sixteenth century. Often said to be the earliest surviving painted landscape created in Scotland is a depiction by the Flemish artist [[Alexander Keirincx]] undertaken for [[Charles I of England|Charles I]].

The [[Capriccio (art)|capriccios]] of Italian and Dutch landscapes undertaken as house decoration by James Norie and his sons in the eighteenth century brought the influence of French artists such as [[Claude Lorrain]] and [[Nicolas Poussin]]. Students of the Nories included [[Jacob More]] whose produced Claudian-inspired landscapes. This period saw a shift in attitudes to the Highlands and mountain landscapes to interpreting them as aesthetically pleasing exemplars of nature. Watercolours were pioneered in Scotland by [[Paul Sandby]] and [[Alexander Runciman]]. [[Alexander Nasmyth]] has been described as &quot;the founder of the Scottish landscape tradition&quot;,&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p433&gt;I. Chilvers, ed., ''The Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 4th edn., 2009), {{ISBN|0-19-953294-X}}, p. 433.&lt;/ref&gt; and produced both urban landscapes and rural scenes that combine Claudian principles of an ideal landscape with the reality of Scottish topography. His students included major landscape painters of the early nineteenth century such as [[Andrew Wilson (artist)|Andrew Wilson]], the watercolourist [[Hugh William Williams]], John Thompson of Duddingston and probably the artists that would be most directly influenced by Nasmyth, John Knox. In the Victorian era, the tradition of Highland landscape painting was continued by figures such as [[Horatio McCulloch]], [[Joseph Farquharson]] and [[William McTaggart]], described as the &quot;Scottish Impressionist&quot;. The fashion for coastal painting in the later nineteenth century led to the establishment of artist colonies in places such as [[Pittenweem]] and [[Crail]].

The first significant group of Scottish artists to emerge in the twentieth century were the [[Scottish Colourists]] in the 1920s. They were [[John Duncan Fergusson]], [[Francis Cadell (artist)|Francis Cadell]], [[Samuel Peploe]] and [[George Hunter (painter)|Leslie Hunter]], who placed an emphasis on colour above form. The group of artists connected with Edinburgh, most of whom had studied at [[Edinburgh College of Art]] during or soon after the First World War, became known as [[the Edinburgh School]]. They were influenced by French painters and the [[St. Ives School]] and their art was characterised by use of vivid and often non-naturalistic colour and the use of bold technique above form. Members included [[William George Gillies|William Gillies]], [[John Maxwell (artist)|John Maxwell]], [[William Crozier (Scottish artist)|William Crozier]] and [[William MacTaggart]]. William Johnstone was one of the artists most closely associated with the [[Scottish Renaissance]], an attempt to introduce modernism into art and to create a distinctive national art. [[Stanley Cursiter]] was influenced by the [[Celtic revival]], [[post-impressionism]] and [[futurism (art)|Futurism]]. Later in his career he became a major painter of the coastline of this native Orkney. Other artists strongly influenced by modernism included [[James McIntosh Patrick]] and [[Edward Baird (artist)|Edward Baird]], both of whom were influenced by surrealism and the work of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Bruegel]].

In the post-war period the English-born [[Joan Eardley]] explored the landscapes of the [[Kincardineshire]] coast and created depictions of Glasgow tenements and children in the streets. Scottish artists that continued the tradition of landscape painting and joined the new generation of modernist artists of the highly influential [[St Ives School]] were [[Wilhelmina Barns-Graham]]  and [[Margaret Mellis]]. Husband and wife Tom MacDonald and [[Bet Low]] with William Senior formed the [[Clyde Group]], aimed at promoting political art and producing industrial landscapes. [[John Bellany]] focused on the coastal communities of his birth. The coastal theme would also be pursued by artists such as Elizabeth Ogilvy, [[Joyce W. Cairns]] and Ian Stephen.

The earliest examples of Scottish landscape painting are in the tradition of [[Scottish Renaissance painted ceilings|Scottish house decoration]] for burgesses, lairds and lords, that arose after the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]] in the sixteenth century, partly as a response to the loss of religious patronage.&lt;ref name=Dawson2007p290&gt;J.

They indicate an awareness of contemporaneous [[Dutch Golden Age painting#Landscapes and cityscapes|Dutch landscape painting]].&lt;ref name=Macmillan1990pp58-61&gt;D. Macmillan, ''Scottish Art, 1460–1990'' (Mainstream, 1990), {{ISBN|1-85158-251-7}}, pp. 58–61.&lt;/ref&gt; The Flemish artist [[Alexander Keirincx]] (1600–52) was active in England and Scotland where he undertook commissions for [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], mainly of royal castles in Northern England and Scotland. These included one showing [[Seton Palace|Seton House]] (1636–37) in its landscape,&lt;ref name=Macmillan1990p67&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art, 1460–1990'', p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; which is often said to be the earliest surviving painted landscape created in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;J. Holloway and L. Errington, ''The Discovery of Scotland: the Appreciation of Scottish Scenery Through Two Centuries of Painting'' (Edinburgh: National Gallery of Scotland, 1978), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The theme of house decoration with landscapes was taken up in the eighteenth century by James Norie (1684–1757), who worked beside the architect [[William Adam (architect)|William Adam]] (1689–1748). Norie, with his sons James (1711–36) and Robert (d. 1766), painted the houses of the peerage with [[Capriccio (art)|capriccios]] or [[pastiche]]s of Italian and Dutch landscapes,&lt;ref name=Baudino2011p153&gt;I.

The Nories were also important figures in professionalisation of Scottish art and the development of art education.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000pp52-3&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0-500-20333-4}}, pp. 52–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JacobMoreNG 1897.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jacob More]], ''The Falls of Clyde: Corra Linn'', c. 1771|alt=Painting of a waterfall with small human figures.]]
Probably a student of the Nories was Charles Steuart (fl. 1762–90), who produced a series of [[Perthshire]] landscapes for the Duke of Atholl at [[Blair Castle]], including ''The Black Lynn, Fall on the Brann'' (1766).&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000pp52-3 /&gt; Also among the students of the Nories was [[Jacob More]], who moved to Italy from 1773 and is chiefly known as a landscape painter who created Claudian-style, classically inspired landscapes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baudino2011p153&quot; /&gt; More's series of four paintings &quot;Falls of Clyde&quot; (1771–73), produced before his departure to Italy, have been described by art historian [[Duncan Macmillan (art historian)|Duncan Macmillan]] as treating the waterfalls as &quot;a kind of natural national monument&quot; and has been seen as an early work in developing a [[Romanticism in Scotland|romantic]] sensibility to the Scottish landscape.&lt;ref name=Withers2001pp151-3 /&gt; This period saw a shift in attitudes to the Highlands and mountain landscapes in general, from viewing them as hostile, empty regions occupied by a backwards and marginal people, to interpreting them as aesthetically pleasing exemplars of nature, occupied by rugged primitives, which were now depicted in a dramatic fashion.&lt;ref name=Withers2001pp151-3&gt;C. W. J. Withers, ''Geography, Science and National Identity: Scotland Since 1520'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-521-64202-7}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;151–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Highly influential in this process was the Scottish philosopher [[Archibald Alison (author)|Archibald Alison]]'s ''Nature and Principles of Taste'' (1790), which widened the forms of landscape seen as appropriate for painting, placing an emphasis on their historical significance and emotional impact on the painter.&lt;ref name=Macmillan1990p219&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art, 1460–1990'', p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Sandby]] (1731–1809), often considered the &quot;father of British watercolour painting&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;M. Hargraves, ''Great British Watercolors: From the Paul Mellon Collection at the Yale Center for British Art'' (Yale University Press, 2007), {{ISBN|0-300-11658-6}}, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; visited Scotland as part of the military survey that followed the [[1745 Jacobite rebellion]] and undertook a number of studies of Scottish scenes.&lt;ref&gt;R. Hewitt, ''Map Of A Nation: A Biography Of The Ordnance Survey'' (Granta Books, 2011), {{ISBN|1-84708-452-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His abandonment of traditional pen and ink drawing, using washes of colour in order to paint directly in watercolours without pen outlines, opened the way for the creation of powerful Romantic landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;A. Wilton, ''The Great Age of British Watercolours: 1750–1880'' (Prestel Verlag GmbH &amp; Company KG., 1997), {{ISBN|3-7913-1879-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Runciman]] (1736–1785) was probably the first artist to paint Scottish landscapes in [[watercolour]]s in the more romantic style that was emerging towards the end of the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;E. K. Waterhouse, ''Painting in Britain, 1530 to 1790'' (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 5th edn., 1994), {{ISBN|0-300-05833-0}}, p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Nasmyth]] (1758–1840) trained in the Trustees Academy in Edinburgh under Runciman. He visited Italy, where he met with More, and worked in London, but returned to his native Edinburgh for most of his career. He produced work in a large range of forms, including his portrait of Romantic poet [[Robert Burns]], which depicts him against a dramatic Scottish background, but he is chiefly remembered for his landscapes and is described in the ''Oxford Dictionary of Art'' as &quot;the founder of the Scottish landscape tradition&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chilvers2009p433&quot; /&gt; He produced both urban landscapes, like ''Edinburgh from Caton Hill'' (1825), which put Edinburgh its geological context, and rural scenes such as ''Castle Huntly and The Tay'' (c. 1800). His works combined Claudian principles of an ideal landscape with the reality of Scottish topography.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000pp78-81&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 78–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nineteenth century ==
{{See also|Scottish art in the nineteenth century}}
Nasmyth was also a highly influential teacher at the Trustee's Academy in Edinburgh. Among his students were painters who took the landscape tradition into the nineteenth century. They included [[Andrew Wilson (artist)|Andrew Wilson]] (1780–1840), who would become Master of the Academy in 1818, the watercolourist [[Hugh William Williams]] (1773–1829), clergyman and artist John Thompson of Duddingston (1778–1840) and probably the artist that would be most directly influenced by Nasmyth, John Knox (1778–1845).&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000pp78-83&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 78–83.&lt;/ref&gt; Williams' most famous work are interpretive versions of Greek landscapes, based on sketches taken on his travels there, among them ''The Temple of Poseidon, Cape Sunium'' (1828). His close friend John Thompson focused on a dark dramatic version of Scottish landscape, as in his most famous work ''Fast Castle from Below'' (1824).&lt;ref name=Macmillan1990pp222-5&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art, 1460–1990'', pp. 222–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Knox directly linked Nasmyth's style with the Romantic literature of [[Walter Scott]].&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Hill, ''Picturing Scotland Through the Waverley Novels: Walter Scott and the Origins of the Victorian Illustrated Novel'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2010), {{ISBN|1-4094-7617-0}} , p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Knox's ''Landscape with Tourists at Lock Katrine'' (c. 1820), was a commentary on the tourist trade that grew up in the [[Trossachs]] in the aftermath of the publication of Scott's poem ''[[The Lady of the Lake (poem)|The Lady of the Lake]]'' in 1810.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000pp82-3&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 82–83.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also among the first artists to take a major interest in depicting the urban landscape of Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;D. Kemp, ''The Pleasures and Treasures of Britain: A Discerning Traveller's Companion'' (Toronto: Dundurn, 1992), {{ISBN|1-55002-159-1}}, p. 401.&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of his career he undertook panoramic works of the views from the top of [[Ben Lomond]], which played a part in opening up the Highlands as a spectacle that would be taken up by artists in the second half of the century.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000pp82-3 /&gt;

[[File:McTaggart, The Storm.jpg|thumb|left|[[William McTaggart]], ''The Storm'', 1890 |alt=Painting of a sea shore in a rough weather.]]
In the Victorian era, the tradition of Highland landscape painting was continued by figures such as [[Horatio McCulloch]] (1806–67), [[Joseph Farquharson]] (1846–1935) and [[William McTaggart]] (1835–1910).&lt;ref name=Szasz200p136&gt;F.

This was helped by the Queen's declared affection for Scotland, signified by her adoption of [[Balmoral Castle|Balmoral]] as a royal retreat.&lt;ref name=Billcliffe2009p27&gt;R. Billcliffe, ''The Glasgow Boys'' (London: Frances Lincoln, 2009), {{ISBN|0-7112-2906-6}}, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; The wildlife around Balmoral was immortalised by English painter [[Edwin Landseer]] (1802–73) in the much copied ''[[Monarch of the Glen (painting)|Monarch of the Glen]]'' (1851).&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p105&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; In this period a Scottish &quot;grand tour&quot; developed with large number of English artists, including [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]], flocking to the Highlands to paint and draw.&lt;ref name=Billcliffe2009p27 /&gt; From the 1870s Farquharson was a major figure in interpreting Scottish landscapes, specialising in snowscapes and sheep, and using a mobile heated studio in order to capture the conditions from life.&lt;ref name=Szasz200p136 /&gt; In the same period McTaggart emerged as the leading Scottish landscape painter. He has been compared with [[John Constable]] and described as the &quot;Scottish Impressionist&quot;, with free brushwork often depicting stormy seas and moving clouds.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p376&gt;Chilvers, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt; The fashion for coastal painting in the later nineteenth century led to the establishment of artist colonies in places such as [[Pittenweem]] and [[Crail]] in Fife,&lt;ref&gt;P.

Key figures included [[William York Macgregor|W. Y.

The first significant group of Scottish artists to emerge in the twentieth century were the [[Scottish Colourists]] in the 1920s. The name was later given to four artists who knew each other and exhibited together, but did not form a cohesive group. All had spent time in France between 1900 and 1914&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p575&gt;Chilvers, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', p. 575.&lt;/ref&gt; and all looked for inspiration to Paris, particularly to the [[Fauvism|Fauvists]], such as [[Monet]], [[Matisse]] and [[Cézanne]], whose techniques they combined with the painting traditions of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author= |contribution= |date= |title=The Scottish Colourists |journal=Explore Art |editor= |edition= |isbn= |issn= |volume= |pages= |place= |publisher= |url=http://www.exploreart.co.uk/results.asp?SF1=art_style&amp;ST1=The%20Scottish%20Colourists&amp;SORT=sort_name |accessdate=12 November 2012 |authorlink= |archiveurl=http://www.exploreart.co.uk/results.asp?SF1=art_style&amp;ST1=The%20Scottish%20Colourists&amp;SORT=sort_name |archivedate=12 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were [[John Duncan Fergusson]] (1874–1961), [[Francis Cadell (artist)|Francis Cadell]] (1883–1937), [[Samuel Peploe]] (1871–1935) and [[George Hunter (painter)|Leslie Hunter]] (1877–1931).&lt;ref name=visit&gt;{{Citation |author= |contribution= |date=|title=The Scottish Colourists |journal=Visit Scotland.com |editor= |edition= |isbn= |issn= |volume= |pages= |place= |publisher= |url=http://www.visitscotland.com/repository/library/932636/1000635/colourists |accessdate=7 May 2010 |authorlink= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429020605/http://www.visitscotland.com/repository/library/932636/1000635/colourists |archivedate=29 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been described as the first Scottish modern artists and were the major mechanism by which [[post-impressionism]] reached Scotland.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p575 /&gt; From 1912 Cadell visited [[Iona]] annually to paint and he was joined there by Peploe from 1920. They produced a number of works using the west-coast light and Iona landscape, particularly views of [[Ben More (Mull)|Ben More]], which both painted several times. [[John Duncan (painter)|John Duncan]], the arts and crafts artist, was still active in the early twentieth century and painted several landscapes similar in style to those of Cadell and Peploe.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p162&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; Hunter used a vibrant palette to create notable paintings of the landscape around [[Balloch, Highland|Balloch]] on Loch Lomond.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000pp163-4&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 163–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Leading architect [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] (1868–1928) abandoned architecture for painting after World War I and created a number of landscapes, particularly of southern France. He became associated with Fergusson, who pursued also experimental landscape in the inter-war years, many of which were around his home in the Highlands, like that at ''Craigcornash'' (c. 1925). The work of Mackintosh and Fergusson has similarities to that of [[David Young Cameron]] (1865–1945) who pursued the systematic painting of the Highlands in his later years.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p178&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

The group of artists connected with Edinburgh, most of whom had studied at [[Edinburgh College of Art]] during or soon after the First World War, became known as [[the Edinburgh School]].&lt;ref name=EdinburghGalleriesEdinbrughSchool&gt;[http://www.edinburghmuseums.org.uk/Venues/City-Art-Centre/Collections/Fine-Art/Scottish-Art-Movements/The-Edinburgh-School &quot;The Edinburgh School&quot;], Edinburgh Museums and Galleries, retrieved 10 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; They were influenced by French painters and the [[St. Ives School]]&lt;ref name=Macmillan2011&gt;D.

William Johnstone (1897–1981) was one of the artists most closely associated with the [[Scottish Renaissance]], an attempt to introduce modernism into art and to create a distinctive national art. He studied cubism, surrealism and was introduced to new American art by his wife the sculptor Flora Macdonald. He moved towards [[Abstract art|abstraction]], attempting to utilise aspects of landscape, poetry and Celtic art. His most significant work, ''A Point in Time'' (1929–38), has been described by art historian Duncan Macmillan as &quot;one of the most important Scottish pictures of the century and one of the most remarkable pictures by any British painter in the period&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art, 1460–1990'', {{ISBN|0-500-20333-4}}, pp. 351–2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gardiner2005p173&gt;M.

Both were influenced by surrealism and the work of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Bruegel]] and focused on landscape, as can be seen in McIntosh Patrick's ''Traquair House'' (1938) and more overtly in Baird's ''The Birth of Venus'' (1934).&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 175–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the post-war period the English-born [[Joan Eardley]] (1921–63) moved to Glasgow, where she was a graduate of the [[Glasgow School of Art]] and explored the landscapes of the [[Kincardineshire]] coast and created depictions of Glasgow tenements and children in the streets.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 191–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish artists that continued the tradition of landscape painting and joined the new generation of modernist artists of the highly influential St Ives School were [[Wilhelmina Barns-Graham]] (1912–2004) and [[Margaret Mellis]] (1914–2009).&lt;ref name=&quot;MacDonald2000p193&quot;&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; Polish [[Realism (arts)|realist]] [[Josef Herman]] (1911–2000) was resident in Glasgow between 1940 and 1943&lt;ref name=Macmillan1990pp370-1&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art, 1460–1990'', pp. 370–1.&lt;/ref&gt; where he influenced husband and wife Tom MacDonald (1914–1985) and Bet Low (born 1924), who with painter William Senior (born 1927) formed the Clyde Group, aimed at promoting political art.

==History==
[[Thomas Davies (British Army officer)|Thomas Davies]] was a British Army officer in the [[Royal Artillery]] and received training in topographic drawing at the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]]. During the [[French and Indian War]], he served under General [[Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffery Amherst]].&lt;ref name=dcb&gt;{{cite book|last=Hubbard|first=R.

Niagara Falls was first described in the journals of [[Samuel de Champlain]] in 1604.{{sfnp|Dow|1921|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ACYVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA17 pp. 17–19]}} The first published eyewitness description was by [[Louis Hennepin]] in ''Description of Louisiana'' (1683). His later work, ''A New Discovery of a Vast Country'' (1697), included the first image of the falls based on his description and not done on site.{{sfnp|Dow|1921|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ACYVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA23 pp. 23–29]}}&lt;ref name=wink&gt;{{cite web|title=The Winkworth Collection: A Treasure House of Canadiana in London|url=http://www.christies.com/features/Winkworth-5675-1.aspx|publisher=[[Christie's]]|date=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davies later painted two additional views of the falls {{circa|1766}}. His work was not well known until after a 1953 auction from the [[Earl of Derby]]'s library.&lt;ref name=christie1/&gt;{{sfnp|Hubbard|1972|pp=20–21}} These paintings were then shown as part of a major exhibition devoted to Davies, 2 July – 4 September 1972, at the [[National Gallery of Canada]].{{sfnp|Hubbard|1972|p=4}}

==Description==
The view is of [[Horseshoe Falls]] from the Canadian bank.&lt;ref name=christie1/&gt; The painting shows a rainbow emerging from the mist, while two [[Iroquois]] watch on the right.

'''''Paysage coloré aux oiseaux aquatiques''''' (''Colored Landscape with Aquatic Birds'') is an oil painting created circa 1907 by the French artist and theorist [[Jean Metzinger]]. ''Paysage coloré aux oiseaux aquatiques'' is a [[Proto-Cubism|Proto-Cubist]] work executed in a [[Divisionism|Post-Divisionist]] style with a unique [[Fauvism|Fauve]]-like palette. Metzinger's broad omnidirectional brushstrokes in the treatment of surfaces render homage to [[Paul Cézanne]], while the luscious subtropical imagery in the painting are an homage to [[Paul Gauguin]] and Metzinger's friend [[Henri Rousseau]].

''Paysage coloré aux oiseaux aquatiques'' is located at the [[Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mam.paris.fr/en/online-collections#/artwork/180000000001284 Jean Metzinger, ''Paysage coloré aux oiseaux aquatiques'', Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''Paysage coloré aux oiseaux aquatiques'' is an oil painting on canvas in a horizontal format with dimensions 75.5 x 101&amp;nbsp;cm (29.7 by 39.8 in). The work represents three aquatic birds in an ambrosial Mediterranean landscape with semi-tropical vegetation, trees, a body of water, mountains and a sailboat in the background. The free and expressive brushstrokes of ''Paysage coloré aux oiseaux aquatiques''—as in ''Les Ibis'' and ''Le Flamant rose et le voilier'' of the same period—represent a loosening of the mosaic-like [[Divisionism|Divisionist]] technique that characterized Metzinger's work from 1905 to early 1907.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joann Moser&quot;&gt;Joann Moser, ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, Pre-Cubist works, 1904–1909'', The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press, 1985, pp. 34-42&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1907 a select group of avant-garde artists in Paris were reevaluating their own work in relation to that of [[Paul Cézanne]]. A retrospective of Cézanne's paintings had been held at the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1904. Current works were displayed at the 1905 and 1906 Salon d'Automne, followed by two commemorative retrospectives after his death in 1907. Metzinger's interest in the work of Cézanne suggests a means by which he made the transformation from Divisionism to Cubism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joann Moser&quot; /&gt;

The lattices of squares or 'cubes' of paint employed throughout his Divisionist period have not been entirely abandoned, but pushed to another extreme. Where before brushstrokes had become increasingly larger and organized into groups of color, now they were larger still and elongated, seemingly blended together directly on the canvas (rather than on a palette). The treatment of color and composition is globally free, loose, expressive, and thus dynamic. There are no inert tones. Colors have retained their brilliance. As before, contrasting hues are placed side by side—resulting in rhythmic and optic vibrational effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mittelmann&quot;&gt;[http://jean-metzinger.blogspot.com.es/ Jean Metzinger: Divisionism, Cubism, Neoclassicism and Post-Cubism]&lt;/ref&gt;

The lines and large strokes of color, like words, are treated autonomously—each possessing an abstract value independent of one another, yet together forming a coherent whole. The impulse toward abstraction becomes a primary quality of Metzinger's work of 1907. Though not without reference to the real world, Metzinger's treatment of the painted surface is meant to draw away from the outward appearance of nature. Imitation is vacated in order to concentrate upon the distillation of essential shapes and movements. These distilled forms were superior to nature because they partook of idea, and represented the dominance of the artist over the mere stuff of nature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robbins 1985&quot;&gt;Daniel Robbins, ''Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism'', 1985, in ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect'', The University of Iowa Museum of Art&lt;/ref&gt;

Complex in both composition and the rendering of color, the subject matter of ''Paysage coloré'', though clearly readable, is to a certain extent faceted and denaturalized. Its combination of painterly techniques, color and exoticism in its subject matter, sets it apart, resulting in a broader scope typically employed to define the Fauve movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mittelmann&quot; /&gt;

The spatial relationships between forms in the foreground and structures in the background are ambiguously flattened. Metzinger had already abandoned classical perspective for the most part since 1903, and now it had become entirely irrelevant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mittelmann&quot; /&gt;

This composition was not only different from [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Georges Seurat]],  [[Henri-Edmond Cross]], [[Paul Sérusier]], [[Maurice Denis]] and [[Odilon Redon]] and the other [[Neo-Impressionism|Neo-Impressionists]], [[Symbolism (art)|Symbolists]] and [[Nabis]], but different from [[Henri Matisse]], [[André Derain]], [[Othon Friesz]] and the other [[Fauvism|Fauves]]. Indeed, Metzinger, unlike others of his immediate circle, or peripheral entourage, would soon become one of the founders of Cubism—flanked between [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]] on the one hand, [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Fernand Léger]] on the other—and this painting was a step in that direction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mittelmann&quot; /&gt;

Note: in ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect'' (1985), the title, dimensions and provenance for this painting, n. 19 of the catalogue, are erroneously switched with n. 18, ''Le Flamant rose et le voilier'', (pages 40 and 41).&lt;ref name=&quot;Joann Moser&quot; /&gt;

'''''Harbour Cone from Peggy's Hill''''' (1939) is an early [[oil painting]] by [[New Zealand]] artist [[Colin McCahon]].

== Subject ==
''Harbour Cone from Peggy's Hill'' is one of McCahon's earliest explorations of the [[Otago]] region. It depicts an elevated stance from the mountain tops, looking down towards Harbour Cone in the [[Otago Peninsula]]. This work is one of his more realistic creations - showing a clear landscape theme.
[[File:Harbour Cone Otago Peninsula.jpg|thumb|Harbour Cone, Otago Peninsula]]

In addition to this exoteric representation, ''Harbour Cone from Peggy's Hill'' also contains more esoteric meanings. McCahon wanted this artwork to express &quot;the concept of nature as a spiritual and redeeming
force.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Spirit&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alderton|first1=Zoe|title=The Spirit of Colin McCahon|date=2015|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|location=Newcastle upon Tyne|isbn=1-4438-7232-6|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to his friend [[Toss Woollaston]] he explained:

{{Quote|text=I imagined people looking at it then looking at the landscape and for once
really seeing it &amp; being happier for it &amp; believing in God &amp; then the
brotherhood of men &amp; the futility of war. |author=Colin McCahon to Toss Woollaston (1939)|source=&lt;ref name=&quot;Elements of Modernism&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Gordon H.|title=Elements of Modernism in Colin McCahon’s Early Work|date=2003|publisher=Victoria University of Wellington School of Art History, Classics and Religious Studies|location=Wellington|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Because of comments such as these, the painting has been read as an evangelical statement designed to connect together God, peace, and the landscape.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spirit&quot; /&gt;

== Reception ==
{{Expand section|date=March 2016}}
=== Early Controversy ===
'' Harbour Cone from Peggy's Hill '' was behind one of the earliest controversies in McCahon's long career. It was excluded from the 1939 [[Otago Art Society]] exhibition, despite the fact that each member (including McCahon) was entitled to display one work. Linda Tyler believes that this rejection was due to the absence of support &quot;from an interested and informed public.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tyler, Linda|chapter=A Matter of Taste: Charles Brasch as Art Collector|editor1-last=Kerr|editor1-first=Donald|title=Enduring Legacy: Charles Brasch, Patron, Poet &amp; Collector|date=2003|publisher=University of Otago Press|location=New Zealand|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Picture clock with Alster Panorama''''' (''German: '''Bilderuhr mit Alsterpanorama''')'' also known as '''''Coffeeparty on the Alster with view to Lombardbridge over the city''''' is a [[picture clock]] or [[music box]] painting (Spieluhr-Gemälde) - an [[oil painting]] of a landscape scene with integrated [[mechanical clock]], [[Automaton|automata]], and music box that is in the collection of the [[Hamburg Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hamburgmuseum.de/de/ausstellungen-highlights/bilderuhr-mit-alsterpanorama.htm|title=Bilderuhr mit Alsterpanorama|website=www.hamburgmuseum.de|publisher=Museum für Hamburgische Geschichte|language=German|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 74&amp;nbsp;cm x 89&amp;nbsp;cm in size, it was made between 1827 and 1830 by unknown group of artists and craftsmen&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063623/GER_280_005.html|title=Kaffeegesellschaft an der Alster mit Blick über Lombardsbrücke auf die Stadt (Uhrenbild - Bilderuhr)|website=www.europeana.eu|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was restored by the museum and watchmaker Helmut Tüxen in 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abendblatt.de/kultur-live/article206903563/Historische-Kunstschaetze-im-Hamburg-Museum.html|title=Historische Kunstschätze im Hamburg Museum|last=|first=|date=2016-01-09|website=www.abendblatt.de|publisher=[[Hamburger Abendblatt]]|language=German|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foreground of the painting shows a group of people drinking [[coffee]] in a park on the banks of the [[Außenalster]] lake. They are accompanied by musicians and children. The background shows the [[Lombardsbrücke]] (''Lombard Bridge'') and behind that a panorama of the city of [[Hamburg]]. From left-to-right the recognisable buildings are:
* [[St. James' Church, Hamburg|St. James' Church]] (''Hauptkirche St. Jacobi'')
* A [[windmill]] on the Alster [[glacis]] (one of the five that still existed on the [[Hamburg Wallring]] at that time)&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;
* The [[Hamburg workhouse]] ([[w:De:Werk- und Zuchthaus|Werk- und Zuchthaus]]) 
* [[St. Peter's Church, Hamburg|St Peter's church]] (''St. Petri'')
* [[St. Catherine's Church, Hamburg|St. Catherine's Church]] (''St. Katharinen'')
* [[St. Nicholas' Church, Hamburg|St. Nicholas' church]] (S''t.Nikolai'')
These landmarks indicates that the scene is set on the Western bank of the Außenalster and oriented directly towards the South at approximately the location where the present day Straße Fontenay reaches the shoreline.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; St Peters', St. Nicholas', and the workhouse were all destroyed in the [[Great Fire of Hamburg]], 12–15 years after the painting was made. The wooden Lombard Bridge was replaced in the 1860s with the version known today and in 1953 the parallel [[Kennedy Bridge (Hamburg)|Kennedy Bridge]] (originally called the &quot;New Lombardsbrücke&quot;) was built. It now obscures the Lombard Bridge from the painting's viewpoint.

== Mechanical elements ==
[[File:Lombardsbrücke um 1860, Photograph J.F. Lau.jpg|thumb|Photograph from 1860 showing the windmill, lake and original bridge, from approximately the same orientation as the painting]]
The several church towers feature working clocks. Other mechanically operated elements of the scene are:
* the windmill turning
* two children playing [[cup-and-ball]]
* a harpist's and a violinist's arms moving
* various boats moving across the lake
* foot and horse-borne traffic crossing the bridge
* a fisherman's [[Fishing rod|rod]]

'''''Camel (in rhythmic landscape with trees''''') [''German: '''Kamel (in rhythmischer baumlandschaft)'''''] is a painting by Swiss artist [[Paul Klee]] in the collection of the [[Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen]] in [[Düsseldorf]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kunstsammlung.de/en/discover/collections/focuses/paul-klee.html|title=Paul Klee|date=|website=Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen|publisher=Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is one of the first Klee did in oils and is typical of the artist's interest in colour theory, draughtsmanship and musicality. It is also one of many images in Western art to use camels as subject matter.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://amor.cms.hu-berlin.de/~h1981d0z/pdf/2015-05-london/soas-london.pdf|title=The representation of the Camel in Western visual arts over 2000 years|last=Schwartz|first=H.J.|date=May 2015|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The composition of the painting is based on horizontal bands dotted with circular shapes.

== Subject  ==
Camels appear in manuscripts, mosaics, sculptures and paintings. For example, camels and horses appear in illustrations to the travel memoir of [[John Mandeville]] in the fourteenth century. [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] paintings of the nineteenth century include ones by artists such as [[Carl Haag]] (&quot;Danger in the Desert&quot;, 1867) and [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] (&quot;Street Scene, Egypt&quot;, 1869).&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; The memorial on the [[Victoria Embankment Gardens]] in London commemorates the [[Imperial Camel Corps Memorial|Imperial Camel Corps]] in sculpture.

The year before, Klee had produced another camel painting in oils entitled &quot;Two Camels and a donkey&quot; (1919).

&quot;Camel in rhythmic landscape with trees&quot; is considered one of a series that includes &quot;Rythmic Tree Landcape&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Paul Klee: dialogue with nature|author1=Paul Klee |author2=Ernst-Gerhard Güse |author3=Richard Verdi |publisher=Prestel|year=1991|isbn=978-3-79131-141-8|location=Munich|pages=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar landscapes, such as &quot;Small rhythmic landscape&quot; were also created at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theartwolf.com/landscapes/klee-small-rhythmic-landscape.htm|title=Small Rhythmic Landscape (c1920)|date=|website=theartwolf.com|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'' I would like now to examine the dimensions of the object in a new light to try to show how it is that the artist frequently arrives at what appears to be such an arbitrary 'deformation' of natural forms.''

''First, he does not attach such intense importance to natural form as do so many realist critics, because, for him, these final forms are not the real stuff of the process of natural creation. For he places more value on the powers which do the forming than on the final forms themselves.''&lt;br&gt; - Paul Klee&lt;ref name=Klee/&gt;
}}

This is the period when the artist was working and teaching at the [[Bauhaus]] in Weimar under the direction of [[Walter Gropius]]. The task of teaching caused Klee to meditate on the problems of art and as a result he produced what [[Herbert Read]] called &quot;the most profound and illuminating statement of the aesthetic basis of the modern movement in art ever made by a practising artist&quot;.&lt;ref name = Klee&gt;{{Cite book|title=Paul Klee on Modern Art|last=Klee|first=Paul|publisher=Faber and Faber|year=1958|isbn=|edition= English edition, with introduction by Herbert Read, translated by Paul Findlay.

'''''Finnmark, Winter''''' (Norwegian: '''''Finnmark, winter''''') is a painting by Norwegian artist [[Anna-Eva Bergman]] in 1966.&lt;ref name=&quot;europeana.eu&quot;&gt;&lt;cite class=&quot;book&quot; id=&quot;CITEREFeuropeana.eu&quot; style=&quot;font-style:normal&quot;&gt;'''('''(en)''')'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#x20;[http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063612/NO_280_010.html Finnmark, Winter, Anna-Eva Bergman]. //&amp;#x20;&amp;#x20;&amp;#x20;europeana.eu.&amp;#x20;Посетен на 25 април 2016 г.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The picture was made with metal foil on canvas&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fondationhartungbergman.fr/sitehhaeb/Anna-Eva-Bergman,36?lang=en|title=Anna-Eva Bergman  - Foundation Hartung Bergman|website=www.fondationhartungbergman.fr|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has dimensions of 150 x 300&amp;nbsp;cm.

The picture is part of the collection of the Fondation Hartung-Bergman in [[Antibes, France]].&lt;ref name=&quot;europeana.eu&quot;/&gt;

==Background==
Although Anna-Eva Bergman was Norwegian, she did most of her work in France, where she participated in numerous exhibitions until her death in 1987. Her principles in art grew from the line drawings she drew for books by herself and others. In her last forty years of production she opted for abstract paintings inspired by nature. Looking for new techniques, she used aluminum, silver and gold foil in her work. 

Beginning in the 1950s, after a visit to the north of Norway, she began to paint its landscapes. 

''Finnmark'' was created with aluminum foil applied to the fabric; a technique that gives a special light to this painting.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It represents an arctic landscape in [[Finnmark]], Norway near the border with [[Russia]] in [[Murmansk]]. A strong contrast is expressed with light and dark areas in horizontal lines, representing the snow objects in the dark northern winter, the relationship between light and shadow in the landscape, creating a perspective effect that allows the viewer to look beyond the [[tundra]] of Finnmark.&lt;ref name=&quot;europeana.eu&quot;/&gt;

'''''Häme road''''' or '''''Hot summer day '''''is the most famous work of [[Werner Holmberg]] (1830&amp;ndash;1860). It was painted in 1860.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063618/FI_280_002.html|title=Road in Häme (A Hot Summer Day)|website=www.europeana.eu|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though short, Holmberg's career helped develop Finnish landscape painting. He combined the traditional landscape painting techniques of the [[atelier]] with the modern outdoor ''en plein air'' landscape.

In the painting, a horse-drawn wagon is travelling along a rolling country road through a pine forest in [[Tavastia (electoral district)|Tavastia]]. The painting depicts the carriage from the rear on a hot day. Trees and vegetation are painted with accuracy and the perspective of the image from the fresh wheel marks in the dirt creates an impression of movement. One can almost smell the dust and pine needles under the wheels.

In 1853, Holmberg was the first Finnish artist to study in [[Düsseldorf]]. From the surviving sketches, it seems Holmberg's ''Road in Häme'' was probably painted in the [[Tampere]] region.

'''''Saint-Georges majeur au crépuscule''''' (Eng: '''''Dusk in Venice''''', '''''San Giorgio Maggiore by Twilight'''''&lt;ref name=&quot;NMW&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; or '''''Sunset in Venice''''') refers to an [[Impressionist]] painting by [[Claude Monet]], which exists in more than one version. Monet painted this subject as part of a series of views of the monastery-island of [[San Giorgio Maggiore]]. These were begun in 1908 when the 68-year-old artist made his only visit to [[Venice]].

==Version in Cardiff==
One version of ''San Giorgio Maggiore at Dusk'' was acquired in Paris by the Welsh art collector [[Gwendoline Davies]]. She bequeathed it to the Art Gallery (now [[National Museum Cardiff]]) in [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]].  The painting is normally on display there.&lt;ref name=&quot;NMW&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/art/online/?action=show_item&amp;item=1336 | title=San Giorgio Maggiore by Twilight | publisher=National Museum Wales ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]: Amgueddfa Cymru) | accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Western&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-242800392.html | title=The Duck Pond That Grew into a 'French' Lake; How Did Claude Monet's Famous Paintings of Water Lilies Inspire Wales' Greatest Art-Collecting Sisters? | publisher=[[Western Mail (Wales)|''Western Mail'']] | author=Williams, Sally (2010)}} Retrieved 2014 via [[HighBeam Research]] (subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt;

==''San Giorgio Maggiore al Crepuscolo'': Description of the painting==
''San Giorgio Maggiore al Crepuscolo'' is approximately two-by-three feet and painted in oil on canvas. It depicts mysterious buildings that seem to magically appear from the surrounding landscape, they almost seem to float in the background.  The forms are gently inserted, though not enough to disguise their identity.  The painting focuses on the [[Church of San Giorgio Maggiore]] with its bell tower rising to the top of the painting. To the right are the faintly visible domes of [[Santa Maria della Salute]] and the mouth of the [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]].

==Monet in Venice==
Monet painted the church of San Giorgio Maggiore in six lighting conditions. With this varied approach, the paintings focused on the ‘nature of experience.’
He was particularly impressed by the Venetian sunsets, “these splendid sunsets which are unique in the world.” He had previously been inspired by other sunsets, such as those of [[Normandy]] (in ''[[Rouen Cathedral (Monet)|Rouen Cathedral]]'' and ''[[Haystacks (Monet)|Haystacks]]'', his series of the 1890s) and London ([[Houses of Parliament series (Monet)|''Houses of Parliament'']]).
[[File:Isola di s giorgio maggiore pano.jpg|thumbnail|This photo separates the campanile and dome of San Giorgio Maggiore, as it is taken from nearer the Grand Canal than the place(s) where Monet's dusk paintings were observed. However, it offers a similar view-point to one of Monet's daytime San Giorgio paintings.&lt;ref name=ima&gt;[http://www.imamuseum.org/collections/artwork/church-san-giorgio-maggiore-venice-monet-claude The Church of San Giorgio Maggiore, Venice], Indianapolis Museum of Art.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Viewpoints===
Monet and his wife [[Alice Hoschedé|Alice]] stayed at the [[Palazzo Barbaro]] for a couple of weeks, and then moved to the Hotel Britannia, where they stayed until December.&lt;ref&gt;The hotel's name has since changed to the Hotel Europa and Regina.[http://www.westineuropareginavenice.com/en/hotel-history]&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Mme. Monet, the Britannia had a view, &quot;if such a thing were possible, even more beautiful than that of Palazzo Barbaro...&quot; 
Monet painted looking out from this hotel, but not, it seems, in the case of this particular painting. Although the view from the hotel included the church of San Giorgio Maggiore, the painting appears to have been viewed from the waterfront known as the [[Riva degli Schiavoni]], where the island forms a focal point of the view.

Monet was reportedly reluctant to paint from the waterfront out of fear of conforming to other artists who were drawn to Venice, such as [[Renoir]] or [[Manet]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/events/exhibitions/extramural/exhibitions/article/manet-ritorno-a-venezia-36755.html?tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=253&amp;cHash=b2bbf4444d Manet. Ritorno a Venezia]. [[Musée d'Orsay]]&lt;/ref&gt;  San Giorgio Maggiore was a favorite subject for painters, including the proto-Impressionist [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/turner-venice-san-giorgio-maggiore-early-morning-d15254 Venice: San Giorgio Maggiore - Early Morning 1819]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/turner-venice-san-giorgio-maggiore-at-sunset-from-the-hotel-europa-d32165 Venice: San Giorgio Maggiore at Sunset, from the Hotel Europa 1840]. [[Tate]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Completion of the paintings in France===
Monet felt Venice was a city &quot;too beautiful to be painted&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intermonet.com/venice/ Claude Monet in Venice]&lt;/ref&gt; which may be why he returned with many paintings unfinished to [[Giverny]], his home in France.&lt;ref name=ima&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  However, he had already retreated from his earlier practice of painting from life, in front of the subject. He worked on the Venetian scenes at home and the death of his wife [[Alice Hoschedé|Alice]] in 1911 seems to have been a factor in their completion. In 1912 he held a successful exhibition ''Claude Monet Venise'' at the gallery [[Bernheim-Jeune]] in Paris.

== In popular culture ==

The painting became familiar in 1999 after its appearance in [[John McTiernan]]’s [[heist film]] [[The Thomas Crown Affair (1999 film)|''The Thomas Crown Affair'']]. In the film the picture is taken from the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].  In fact, the Metropolitan does not own the painting, although they have another of Monet's Venetian scenes ''[[The Doge's Palace Seen from San Giorgio Maggiore (Claude Monet)|The Doge's Palace Seen from San Giorgio Maggiore]]''.

A Venetian painting by Monet was seized in July of 2016 by Swiss officials on behalf of U.S. authorities. It was described as being a painting of San Giorgio Maggiore. The owner, [[Jho Low]], [[1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal|embezzled funds]] from [[1Malaysia Development BHD.]], a government investment fund.  He had purchased the painting for $35 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-the-1mdb-net-an-art-world-whale-1469091601|title=In the 1MDB Net, an Art-World Whale|last=Crow|first=Kelly|date=2016-07-21|last2=Letzing|first2=John|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The depiction of '''winter landscapes in [[Western art history|Western art]]''' begins in the 15th century. Wintry and snowy landscapes are not seen in early European painting since most of the subjects were religious. Painters avoided landscapes in general for the same reason. The first depictions of snow began to occur in the 15th and 16th centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Earth Environments p. 863&quot;&gt;''Earth Environments: Past, Present and Future'', by David Huddart &amp; Tim Stott, p. 863 (quoted), 2010, John Wiley &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|9780470749609}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Painting]]s that feature snow as a [[theme (arts)|theme]] are mostly [[landscapes]], even if some of these works involve [[religious]] or even [[fantasy]] landscapes. Most of these winter landscapes in art history are [[plein-air]] depictions of winter scenes, using the quality of gray winter light to create the special winter atmosphere.
Depiction of snow in Europe is essentially a northern European theme.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kent 2004&quot;&gt;{{Citation | last = Kent | first = Neil | title = Soul of the North: a Social, Architectural and Cultural History of the Nordic Countries, 1700-1940 | publisher = Reaktion Books | location = London | year = 2004 | isbn = 1-86189-067-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Between Renaissance and the eve of Romanticism===
[[File:Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry février.jpg|thumb|upright|''February'', attributed to [[Limbourg brothers|Paul Limbourg]], or the &quot;Rustic painter&quot;, 1412 and 1416, [[Musée Condé]].]]
Early European painters generally did not depict snow since most of their paintings were of religious subjects. The first artistic representations of snow came in the 15th and 16th centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Earth Environments p. 863&quot;/&gt; Because frequent snowfall is a part of winter in northern European countries, depiction of snow in Europe began first in the northern European countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kent 2004&quot;/&gt;

Since the early 15th century, wintry scenes had been represented by artists in parts of large sculptural works on churches and even on a smaller scale in private devotional scripts such as the [[book of hours]], a devotional collection of texts, [[prayer]]s and [[psalm]]s. These were often [[illuminated manuscript]]s such as ''[[Labours of the Months]],'' a cycle of twelve paintings that illustrated the social life, the agricultural tasks, the weather, and the landscape for each month of the year. January and February were typically shown as snowy, as is ''February'' in the famous cycle of the ''[[Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry]]'', illustrated 1412–1416. Some snowy scenes also appear in a set of early 14th-century frescoes created by Master Wenceslas for the Bishop's Palace at Trento, showing people throwing snowballs at each other,&lt;ref&gt;Florian Heine, &quot;The First Time: Innovations in Art&quot;, Bucher, Munich, 2007 at 33&lt;/ref&gt; and in a detail of [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]]'s ''Effects of Good Government in the City and Countryside'' (1337–39).&lt;ref&gt;Philip McCouat, &quot;The Emergence of the Winter Landscape&quot;, Journal of Art in Society,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artinsociety.com/the-emergence-of-the-winter-landscape.html|title=&quot;The Emergence of the Winter Landscape&quot;,|publisher=www.artinsociety.com|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bjws.blogspot.se/2014/01/illuminated-manuscript-snow.html|title=illuminated-manuscript-snow|publisher=bjws.blogspot.se|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At that time, landscapes had not yet developed as a genre in art, which explains the scarcity of winter scenes in medieval painting. Snow was not depicted in art except where it had a context, such as in the winter months of calendars.

During the Early [[Northern Renaissance]] and even more during the [[Dutch Golden Age]] in the 17th century, interest in landscape painting was increasing. The winter of 1564–1565 was said to be the longest and most severe for more than a hundred years&amp;nbsp;– the beginning of a cold period in northern Europe now called the [[Little Ice Age]]. For the next 150 years, northern European winters were comparatively snowy and harsh. Crop failures, heavy snowfalls and advancing glaciers that consumed Alpine pastures and villages made the era a grim one for European peasants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jan/07/brief-history-snow-britain-charlie-english|title=brief-history-snow-britain|publisher=/www.theguardian.com|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was early in the frigid winter of 1565 that Bruegel created ''[[The Hunters in the Snow]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/hunters-in-the-snow-winter/WgFmzFNNN74nUg?projectId=art-project|title=hunters-in-the-snow-winter|publisher=www.google.com|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; regarded as the first true winter landscape painting. It was part of a series that illustrated the months, something thematically similar to the traditional Flemish [[book of hours|books of hours]] (e.g. the [[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stokstad, Cothren|first=Marilyn, Michael|title=Art History- Fourteenth to Seventeenth Century Art|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the snowy ''Hunters'' (December–January), it included ''[[The Harvesters (painting)|The Harvesters]]'' (August). ''The Hunters'' depicts village life in a snowbound Flemish setting, showing not only hunters with pikes trudging off with their dogs to seek game, but also villagers gathered around a fire, frozen ponds with skaters, and houses and churches in the distance&amp;nbsp;– all against a fanciful backdrop of snow-covered mountains. The series was commissioned in 1565 by a wealthy patron in Antwerp, [[Niclaes Jonghelinck]]. The paintings by Flemish artist [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] were on a larger scale than calendar paintings; they measured approximately three feet by five feet (0.9 by 1.5 meters).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foote|first=Timothy|title=The World of Bruegel|year=1968|publisher=Time-Life Library|location=Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruegel continued to depict snow in his paintings. He created the first nativity scene to include snow, ''[[The Adoration of the Magi]]''. He also started a vogue for [[Netherlandish]] winter painting. The popularity of landscapes in the Netherlands was in part a reflection of the virtual disappearance of religious painting in a now Protestant (Calvinist) society, which preferred non-religious themes such as [[still life]], [[genre painting]], and landscape painting. The tradition of painting landscapes continued well into the 19th century and developed into the [[Romantic painting|Romantic landscape]]. Between 1780 and 1820, following the initial vogue in the 16th century for Netherlandish winter landscapes, winter subjects again become popular. However, this time winter landscapes became popular in their own right, as the beginning of the Romantic movement created a new interest in the landscape. This new interest, combined with the decline of religious painting in the 18th and 19th centuries all over Europe, gave landscape painting for its own sake, not simply as a backdrop to a scene or a setting, a much greater and more prestigious place in 19th-century art than it had held earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Earth Environments p. 863&quot;/&gt;

===Romantic landscape painting===
[[File:Caspar David Friedrich - Winterlandschaft (London).jpg|thumbnail|288px| Caspar David Friedrich: ''Winter Landscape'' (c.&amp;nbsp;1811)]]
Later, after a relatively warm period that coincided with the end of the 17th century [[Dutch Golden Age]], the European climate turned cool again, heading for a trough whose lowest point was in the second decade of the 19th century. In 1809, a series of major volcanic eruptions heralded the arrival of a particularly cold period as the clouds of ash partially blocked out the sun. The decade from 1810 to 1819 was the coldest in England since the 17th century. In 1812, the French [[Grande Armée]] was forced to retreat from Moscow by the advancing winter&amp;nbsp;– known to the Russians as General Snow. These climactic events played a great part in the development of a new art genre, the winter landscape.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jan/07/brief-history-snow-britain-charlie-english]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 18th century, the growing Romantic movement intensified interest in landscape painting, including winter landscapes. Practitioners included the German artist [[Caspar David Friedrich]], who depicted remote and wild landscapes. Caspar David Friedrich was a romantic landscape painter, and was one of the first artists to portray winter landscapes as austere, forbidding and desolate. His winter scenes are solemn and still. They are often painted [[plein-air]], with the artist using the thin, gray light of winter to create an appropriate atmosphere and illustrate the effect of light reflected off snow. According to the art historian Hermann Beenken, Friedrich painted winter scenes in which &quot;no man has yet set his foot&quot;. Although based on direct observation, his landscapes did not reproduce nature but were painted to create a dramatic effect, using nature as a mirror of human emotions. His aim was a reunion with the spiritual self through the contemplation of nature, paralleling Romanticism's validation of intense emotions such as apprehension, fear, horror, terror and awe. Awe in particular&amp;nbsp;– experienced when confronting the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublimity]] of untamed nature and its picturesque qualities&amp;nbsp;– drew Friedrich's interest, as seen in his idealized portrayals of coasts, forests and craggy mountains. Friedrich created the notion of a landscape full of romantic feeling&amp;nbsp;– ''die romantische Stimmungslandschaft''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elizabeth Prettejohn|Prettejohn, Elizabeth]] (2005). ''Beauty &amp; Art, 1750–2000''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 54–56. {{ISBN|0-19-280160-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HB&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=Beenken|first=Hermann|date=April 1938|title=Caspar David Friedrich|journal=[[The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs]]|volume=72|issue=421|pages=171–175|jstor=867281}}&lt;/ref&gt; His works detail a wide range of geographical features, and he used the landscape as an expression of religious [[mysticism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Academic American Encyclopedia | publisher = Grolier | location = Danbury | year = 1989|page=332 | isbn = 0-7172-2024-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with other Romantic painters, Friedrich helped position [[landscape painting]] as a major genre within Western art. His style influenced his contemporary, the Norwegian [[Johan Christian Dahl]] (1788–1857), and, later, [[Arnold Böcklin]] (1827–1901) and many Russian painters, in particular [[Arkhip Kuindzhi]] (c. 1842–1910) and [[Ivan Shishkin]] (1832–98).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Epstein|first=Suzanne Latt|title=The Relationship of the American Luminists to Caspar David Friedrich|publisher=Columbia University|location=New York|year=1964|oclc=23758262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of the 18th-century [[Düsseldorf School]] is characterized by finely detailed but still fanciful landscapes, often portraying religious or allegorical stories. Leading members of the Düsseldorf School advocated [[En plein air|plein-air]] painting and tended to use a [[Palette (painting)|palette]] of relatively subdued and muted colors. The Düsseldorf School grew out of, and was a part of, the [[Germany|German]] [[Romantic movement]]. Prominent members of the Düsselorf School included [[Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow]], [[Rudolf Koller]], [[Karl Friedrich Lessing]], [[Johann Wilhelm Schirmer]], [[Andreas Achenbach]], [[Hans Fredrik Gude]], [[Oswald Achenbach]] and [[Adolf Schrödter]].&lt;ref name=&quot;humboldt&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Humboldt|first=Wilhelm von|title=Gesammelte Schriften. 1.

French painters were slower to develop landscape painting, but from about the 1830s [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]] and other artists of the [[Barbizon School]] established a French landscape tradition that in the 19th century would become the most influential in Europe.

It is often assumed that [[plein-air]] painting started with the 19th-century [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], but in fact it was already common in the late 18th century when the members of the [[Hudson River School]] of American [[landscape art|landscape]] painters were already painting in plein-air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jamesgurney.com/interview.html|title=interview|publisher=jamesgurney.com|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[I really like the work before 1860 the best. People often assume that plein-air painting started with the Impressionists, but it's much older than that, going back to the late 18th Century. The Hudson River School painters, under the influence of Asher B. Durand, were the first to make a regular practice of it, and they often made more sensitive observations than later plein-air painters, because they weren't influenced by the notion of &quot;art for art's sake.&quot; Art does not exist for its own sake. The purpose of art is not to make an aesthetically pleasing picture; it should be much more—to tell a story, reveal a character, convey an emotion, or express some truth about nature.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://art-landscape.blogspot.se/2010/05/what-is-plein-air-painting.html|title=plein-air-painting|publisher=art-landscape.blogspot.se|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Frederic Edwin Church]], a central figure in the [[Hudson River School]], was known for painting large landscapes that he saw during his travels to the Arctic and Central and South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/dallasmuseumofart/docs/dma_voyageoftheicebergs|title=Voyage of the Icebergs -online book|publisher=/issuu.com/dallasmuseumofart|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Plein-air painting, in its strictest sense, is the practice of painting landscape pictures out-of-doors; more loosely, the achievement of an intense impression of the open air (French: plein air) in a landscape painting. Until the time of the painters of the Barbizon school in mid-19th-century France, it was normal practice to execute rough sketches of landscape subjects in the open air and produce finished paintings in the studio. Part of this was a matter of convenience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/464567/plein-air-painting|title=plein-air-painting|publisher=global.britannica.com|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Impressionists were the first artists who made plein-air painting a major genre. They painted outdoors and were interested in real-life subject matter. Their most evident preoccupation and interest was capturing the effect of light and weather at a particular moment&amp;nbsp;– they often painted the same theme all over again in different light and different weather. The Impressionists were influenced in many of their subjects by Japanese woodblock prints. The themes of falling snow and figures with umbrellas in snow are frequent subjects in the [[ukiyo-e]] Japanese woodblock prints.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.mfa.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/boulevard-saint-denis-argenteuil-in-winter-34290|title=boulevard-saint-denis-argenteuil-in-winter|publisher=www.mfa.org|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://culturevulture.net/art-architecture/impressionists-in-winter/|title=impressionists-in-winter|publisher=culturevulture.net|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecultureconcept.com/circle/monets-garden-melbourne-winter-masterpieces-exhibition|title=Monet’s Garden – Melbourne Winter Masterpieces Exhibition|publisher=www.thecultureconcept.com|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[During the latter half of the nineteenth century (1874 – 1886) many people found it difficult to cope with this new vision. It was all about capturing the moment, the joy of life and revealing many of its secrets or truths.]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that a series of severe winters in France also contributed to an increase in the number of winter landscapes produced by Impressionists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rathbone|1999|p=22}}; {{harvnb|Sweeney|1999|pp=23–27}}; For the range of 63 major works produced from 1867–1893, see Moffett et al. 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Impressionist painters like [[Claude Monet]], [[Alfred Sisley]] and [[Camille Pissarro]] started painting large numbers of winter landscapes in which they experimented with the use of light and color to paint what they called the ''effets de neige'' (the effects of snow). Other painters who painted winter landscapes but less frequently were [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Gustave Caillebotte]] and [[Paul Gauguin]]. The French master [[Claude Monet]]'s first painting in his winter series of 140 paintings was ''A Cart on the Snowy Road at [[Honfleur]]'', which was followed by many other winter landscapes, including a long series with haystacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/arts/artwork/claude-monet-paintings-1889-18948.htm|title=claude-monet-paintings-1889|publisher=entertainment.howstuffworks.com|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the painting ''Boulevard Saint Denis'', Monet sought to catch the moment when the sun was hidden behind the clouds during a light snowfall.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.mfa.org&quot;/&gt; In ''[[The Magpie (Monet)|The Magpie]]'', Monet's largest and probably most widely known winter painting, he used blue-gray colors to depict shadows in the snow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claude-monet.com/the-magpie.jsp|title=the-magpie|publisher=www.claude-monet.com|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zucapaca.com/best-of-monet/claude-monet-1868-1869-the-magpie/|title=claude-monet-1868-1869-the-magpie|publisher=www.zucapaca.com|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the natural outdoor light that made the Impressionist's treatment of subjects different. They closely observed the various colors of light that were reflected from objects and captured those colors in their paintings. Since Impressionists painted in ''[[plein air]]'', the shadows reflected the light of the sky as it was reflected onto surfaces.

Impressionists generally used vivid colors, with often thick application of paint, and real-life subject matter. The new technology of premixed paints in tin tubes aided the development of this style.&lt;ref&gt;http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=0300050356&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, painters had made their own paints by grinding and mixing dry pigment powders with linseed oil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phillipscollection.org/docs/education/lbp-kit_4.pdf Renoir and the Impressionist Process]. ''[[The Phillips Collection]]'', 2014&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the 1860s, many vivid synthetic pigments became commercially available such as [[cobalt blue]], [[viridian]], [[cadmium yellow]] and synthetic [[ultramarine blue]], as well as even newer colors such as [[cerulean blue]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallert_159&quot;&gt;Wallert, Arie; Hermens, Erma; Peek, Marja (1995).

As a result, the Impressionists soon moved toward a brighter style of painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Stoner, J.H. |author2=Rushfield, R. |year=2013 |title=Conservation of Easel Paintings |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis  |isbn=9781136000416 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1msM3h9mbaoC |page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1870s, [[Monet]], [[Renoir]], and [[Pissarro]] usually chose to paint on grounds of a light grey or beige colour, but some of the Impressionists had come to prefer white grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=0300050356|title=Impressionists|publisher=/yalepress.yale.edu|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''In High Azure''''' («В голубом просторе») is a masterpiece  by Russian artist [[Arkady Rylov]] (1870–1939), painted in 1918. It is exhibited in the [[Tretiakov Gallery]],  Moscow.

==History==
Painted in 1918 in [[Petrograd]].

== Description ==

At the background of high azure sky and snow-white clouds we can see swans flying over the dark blue sea. Massive cold snow-covered rocks are seen on the horizon. There is a ship under full sail adding to romantic character of the dark stormy sea. The swans' flight is free and easy as if they swim in light transparent air. The outline of the clouds over the horizon emphasizes the birds' flight direction. Though they move from right to left you do not feel that the motion continues beyond the bounds of the picture. Swans seem to move towards the sailing ship and go back ( over snow-covered rocks) to the right corner of the canvas.

Gerardo Murillo Cornado, was the real name of the artist known as [[Dr. Atl]]. He was an avid researcher of nature, and he is considered to be the ideologist of the Muralist Movement, since he imposed a style that was later absorbed by Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, José Clemente Orozco, José Chávez Morado, among other renowned artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cultura.gob.mx/noticias/artes-plasticas-y-fotografia/28545-gerardo-murillo-el-dr-atl-expreso-a-traves-de-diversas-disciplinas-su-pasion-por-las-artes-y-la-ciencia.html|title=Gerardo Murillo, el Dr. Atl|last=|first=|date=21 October 2016|website=www.cultura.gob.mx|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atl began his studies in art at the workshop of Felipe Castro and finished at the Academy of San Carlos. In addition to his penchant to the plastic arts, he became interested in literature, and wrote stories, novels, poetry and even wrote his own biography ''Profane People in the convent'' [''Gentes profanes en el convento''], 1950, in which he described his passion for nature as well as the Mexican landscape: ''nothing has ever provoked in me a feeling as deep as walking for three or four days to reach the high slopes of a mountain, settle amongst them in a cave or in a makeshift hut, and draw pleasantly as nature appeared before my eyes.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Museo Soumaya.Fundación Carlos Slim, Tomo II|last=Palhares Meza|first=Héctor|publisher=Museo Soumaya.Fundación Carlos Slim|year=2015|isbn=|location=Mexico|pages=480|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From his travels through the mountains and volcanoes of Mexico he took inspiration for his paintings such as ''Sunlight between the Mountains'' [''Rayos de sol entre la sierra''], where he found the telluric force for expressive landscape validating it through color and violent strokes, which would become the guidelines for modern painting in Mexico. The study of these new insights led him to create the technique called aeropaisaje or which consists in the reproduction of full views taken from a helicopter where he made his reconnaissance trips.

'''''Landscape with Charon Crossing the Styx''''' is a painting by the Flemish [[Northern Renaissance]] artist [[Joachim Patinier]]. Dating to c. 1515–1524, it is in the [[Museo del Prado]] of [[Madrid]], [[Spain]].

''Landscape with Charon Crossing Styx'' fits into common Northern Renaissance and early Mannerist trends of art. The 16th century witnessed a new era for painting in [[Germany]] and the [[Netherlands]] that combined influences from local traditions and foreign influences. Many artists, including Patinier, traveled to [[Italy]] to study and these travels to the south provided new ideas, particular concerning representations of the natural world. Patinier's religious subjects, therefore, incorporate precise observation and naturalism with fantastic landscapes inspired by the northern traditions of Bosch.

==Iconography==
It depicts the classical subject related by [[Virgil]] in his ''Aeneid'' (book 6, line 369) and [[Dante]] in the ''Inferno'' (book 3, line 78) at the centre of the picture within the [[Christian]] traditions of the [[Last Judgment]] and the [[Ars moriendi]]. The larger figure in the boat is [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]], who transports the souls of the dead to the gates of [[Hades]]. The passenger in the boat, too minute to distinguish his expressions, is a human soul deciding between [[Heaven]], to his right (the viewer's left), or [[Hell]], to his left. The river [[Styx]] divides the painting down the centre. It is one of the four rivers of the underworld that passes through the deepest part of hell. On the painting's left side is the fountain of [[Paradise]], the spring from which the river [[Lethe]] flows through Heaven.

On the right side of the composition is Patinier's vision of Hell, drawing largely on [[Hieronymus Bosch|Boschian]] influences. He adapts a description of [[Hades]], in which,  according to the [[Greeks|Greek]] writer Pausanias, one of the gates was located at the southern end of the Peloponnesus, in an inlet still visible on the [[Cape Matapan]]. In front of the gates is [[Cerberus]], a three-headed dog, who guards the entrance of the gate and frightens all the potential souls who enter into Hades. The soul in the boat ultimately chooses his destiny by looking toward Hell and ignoring the angel on the river-bank in Paradise that beckons him to the more difficult path to Heaven.

==Composition and colour==
Patinier utilised a ''[[Weltlandschaft]]'' (&quot;world landscape&quot;) composition with a three-colour scheme typical of his work, moving from brown in the foreground, to bluish-green, to pale blue in the background). This format, which Patiner is widely acknowledged as popularising, provides a bird's-eye view over an expansive landscape. Furthermore, the painting uses colour to visibly depict heaven and hell, good and evil. To the viewer's left is a heavenly place with bright blue skies, crystal blue rivers with a luminous fountain and angels accenting the grassy hills. On the far right of the painting is a dark sky engulfing Hell and the hanged figures on its gate. Fires blaze in the hills. The foreground of the painting consists of brown rocks in Heaven and brown burnt trees in Hell. 

In the middle-ground is the river and the grasslands in bright hues of blue and green. The background, which is cut off by the horizon line of the darker blue river, is a pale blue sky highlighted with white and gray clouds.  This compositional form is applied here by the crowded left and right sides bracketed by hills, which pushes the viewer's eye into the open space in the middle and reinforces that the men in the boat are the main focus of the painting.

'''''Landscape with the Good Samaritan''''' is a [[1638 in art|1638]] oil on oak panel painting by [[Rembrandt]]. It is one of only six oil landscapes by the artist and with ''[[The Girl in a Picture Frame]]'' and ''[[The Scholar at the Lectern]]'', it is also one of only three Rembrandt paintings in Polish collections. It shows the parable of the [[Good Samaritan]] from the [[Gospel of Luke]].

It was bought at a [[Paris]] auction by [[Jean-Pierre Norblin de La Gourdaine]] and therefore passed into the Polish noblewoman [[Izabela Czartoryska]]'s collection at the [[Dom Gotycki (Puławy)|Dom Gotycki]] at [[Puławy]]. That collection was later moved to [[Krakow]] and so it was one of several painting looted by the Germans in 1939. After World War Two, thanks to research by the art historian [[Karol Estreicher (junior)|Karol Estreicher]], it was returned to Krakow and is now in the city's [[Czartoryski Museum]]. That museum and its whole collection (including ''Landscape'') were sold to the Polish state for 100 million Euros in December 2016.

'''''The Mill''''' is a painting by Dutch [[baroque]] artist [[Rembrandt|Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn]]. It is in the permanent collection of the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington DC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=1201 NGA Washington]&lt;/ref&gt; For a long time, the attribution to Rembrandt was regarded as doubtful; it has been restored in recent years, although it is not universally accepted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://staff.science.uva.nl/~fjseins/RembrandtCatalogue/r_1641_1650.html Online Rembrandt catalogue]&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was formerly in the [[Orleans Collection]]. It was once owned by [[Peter Arrell Brown Widener]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OmAoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA320#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=American Art Annual, Volume 13 | publisher=MacMillan Company | author=Levy, Florence Nightingale | year=1917 | pages=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This painting was documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1915, who wrote; &quot;952. LANDSCAPE WITH A WINDMILL [commonly called, The Mill]. [[John Smith (art historian)|Sm.]] 601 ; [[Wilhelm von Bode|Bode]] 142 ; [[Eugène Dutuit|Dut.]] 452 ; [[Alfred von Wurzbach|Wb.]] 211 ; B.-HdG. 345. Beside a broad moat, high above the circular scarp of a ruined bastion, stands a windmill with some low cottages. The path from the mill leads, on the left, over a little bridge across a sluice, to a landing-post in the foreground. A woman with a child goes down to the water ; a man pushes a barrow upwards. In the centre foreground a woman at the water's edge is washing linen. A man behind watches her. From the right approaches a ferry-boat with the mast down, rowed by a man. To the right on the farther bank, amid dense groves of trees, are some cows, and beyond them a cottage. Evening light. The last rays of the sun illumine the right half of the sky and envelop the mill in their radiant glow. Painted about 1650. Canvas, 34 inches by 41 inches.

A copy on panel, 34 1/2 inches by 39 1/2 inches was exhibited at the Grafton Gallery, London, 1911, No. 67 [by T. Humphry Ward]. Etched by Mathieu, Dequevauviller, Turner, P. J. Arendzen.

'''''Vesuvius from Posillipo by Moonlight''''' was painted by [[Joseph Wright of Derby]] in 1774. It is an oil painting of [[Mount Vesuvius]] in the distance, from the coastal shores of [[Naples]] at night. Dark grey smoke spews from the glowing red crater of the volcano and fills up the top right of the canvas, in contrast to the pale glow of moonlight to the left. Known as a &quot;Painter of Light,&quot; Wright liked to play with highlights and shadows in his works and was most well known for his &quot;Candlelight Pictures,&quot; landscape or genre scenes depicting dramatic contrasts between light and dark.&lt;ref&gt;Pressly, William. &quot;A World of Trouble.&quot; DRUM. 2009. 20 Mar. 2013. &lt;http://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/1903/9309/1/Fox_umd_0117N_10337.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Through utilizing this technique, Joseph Wright exhibits the sublimity of nature in ''Vesuvius from Posillipo by Moonlight'' as well as his other paintings of Mt. Vesuvius.

Wright made a trip to Italy in 1733, where he acquired a wealth of new sights and experiences which greatly influenced his art. He drew and wrote extensively about ancient Roman and Italian art and architecture, and Italian landscapes and coastal scenes, especially around Naples.&lt;ref&gt;Gerry. &quot;Joseph Wright of Derby.&quot; Thats How The Light Gets In.

''Vesuvius from Posillipo'' by Moonlight was painted in Europe during the Neoclassical period. In response to the discovery of the ancient Roman cities, the king of Naples appeared to have encouraged the exploration of Mt. Vesuvius, Pompeii, Herculaneum,  and the Bay of Naples.  This likely lead numerous artists, such as Wright himself, to go to England and become inspired by the sublimity of Mt. Vesuvius.&lt;ref&gt;Pressly, William. &quot;A World of Trouble.&quot; DRUM. 2009. 20 Mar. 2013. 	&lt;http://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/1903/9309/1/Fox_umd_0117N_10337.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Occurring at the same time was the Enlightenment movement, towards which Wright contributed his more popular scientifically and industrially themed works, especially his two most famous pieces: [[A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery]] and [[An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump]].&lt;ref&gt;Schiff, Bennett. &quot;From The Midlands, A Unique Master Of Light And Color.&quot; Smithsonian 21.6 (1990): 50. Academic Search Premier. Web. 20 Mar. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; These typically displayed scientific demonstrations in a dimly lit room, suggesting the idea that society should revolve around education. Even though ''Vesuvius from Posillipo by Moonlight'' is not of a directly historical or scientific theme, Wright may have painted Mt. Vesuvius because he felt that it was an important part of history to preserve and be aware of, in addition to his fascination by its nature. Today, is evident that the 79 A.D. eruption of Mt. Vesuvius was indeed a major catastrophic event, because two cities with great archaeological artifacts of ancient Rome lie beneath its volcanic ashes.

[[File:Forest landscape with a merry company in a cart, by Meindert Hobbema.jpg|thumb|A more typical Hobbema, ''Forest landscape with a merry company in a cart'', [[Rijksmuseum]], c. 1665]]

'''''The Avenue at Middelharnis''''' is a [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] of 1689 by [[Meindert Hobbema]], now in the [[National Gallery, London]].  It is in [[oil painting|oil]] on canvas and measures {{convert|103.5|x|141|cm}}.  It shows a road leading to the village of [[Middelharnis]] on the island of [[Goeree-Overflakkee]] in the [[Maas]] delta in [[South Holland]], the [[Netherlands]].  

The painting has long been one of the best-known Dutch [[landscape painting]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Langmuir, 205&lt;/ref&gt; and certainly Hobbema's best-known work,&lt;ref&gt;Lörzing, 42&lt;/ref&gt; at least in the English-speaking world: &quot;it is as if the artist had produced only a single picture&quot; according to [[Christopher Lloyd (art historian)|Christopher Lloyd]].&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, 77&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Cornelis Hofstede de Groot]], the great specialist of a century ago, thought it &quot;the finest picture, next to [[Rembrandt]]'s ''[[Syndics of the Drapers' Guild|Syndics]]'', which has been painted in Holland&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, 77&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Michael Levey]], &quot;it occupies a position in painting somewhat equivalent to that in poetry of ''[[Gray's Elegy]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Levey, 151&lt;/ref&gt; and for [[Seymour Slive]] &quot;it is the swan song of Holland's great period of landscape painting which fully deserves its high reputation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 207&lt;/ref&gt;  For [[Gerald Reitlinger]], it &quot;soars above the other nine National Gallery Hobbemas&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Reitlinger, 338 (now the NG only recognises 9 Hobbemas in total in its collection)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The untypically symmetrical and frontal composition of the painting appears to record very accurately the view Hobbema saw;&lt;ref&gt;Levey, 151; MacLaren, 177; Slive, 206&lt;/ref&gt; the [[alder]] trees along the road were planted in 1664.&lt;ref&gt;Levey, 151&lt;/ref&gt;  It is signed and dated in the reflection on the ditch at right: &quot;M:hobbema/f 1689&quot;, &lt;ref&gt;MacLaren, 177&lt;/ref&gt; over twenty years after Hobbema largely gave up painting,&lt;ref&gt;MacLaren, 175; Slive, 206&lt;/ref&gt; and right at the end of the Dutch Golden Age landscape period.&lt;ref&gt;Langmuir, 205; Slive, 206–207, and the rest of his chapter.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The village is seen from the south-east.  The road was called the Boomgaardweg, but is now the Steene Weg.&lt;ref&gt;MacLaren, 177; [[:File:Middelharnis 1866.png|Boomgaardweg on this map from 1866, directly below the title &quot;Middelharnis&quot;]]; {{coord|51.754420|4.169944}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The top of the church tower has been rebuilt, and the spire was removed by the French in 1811 to make a [[semaphore]] station, connecting [[The Hague]] with Paris.  The smaller tower to the right of the church, seen between the trees, is the town hall, built in 1639, and the barn to the right survived until the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;MacLaren, 177&lt;/ref&gt; 

The village lies on the edge of the island and was a fishing port; ships' masts and a beacon with a tripod support can be seen in the distance to the right of the avenue, on the beach facing the [[Haringvliet]].&lt;ref&gt;MacLaren, 176&lt;/ref&gt;  This was then a salt-water channel, but has been dammed and turned into a fresh-water lake in modern times.  The island was detached from the mainland when the Haringvliet formed as a result of two major flooding events.  The first was in 1216, which breached the dunes of [[Voorne-Putten|Voorne]] and created a deep saltwater inlet. In the [[St. Elizabeth flood]]s of 1421, this inlet connected to the [[Merwede]] and became an important estuary of the [[Rhine]] and [[Meuse (river)|Meuse]] rivers.

==Context==
[[File:Aelbert Cuyp Avenue at Meerdervoort.jpg|thumb|[[Aelbert Cuyp]], ''The Avenue at [[Meerdervoort]]'', 1650–1652, [[Wallace Collection]]]]
[[Meindert Hobbema]] (1638–1709) was a pupil of [[Jacob van Ruisdael]], the pre-eminent landscape painter of the [[Dutch Golden Age]], and in his mature period produced paintings developing one aspect of his master's more varied output, showing very different scenes from this painting.  Hobbema specialized in &quot;sunny forest scenes opened by roads and glistening ponds, fairly flat landscapes with scattered tree groups, and [[water mill]]s&quot;, including over thirty of the last in paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 206 quoted; Loughman&lt;/ref&gt;  

His paths or roads normally wind diagonally across his composition through dense trees and vegetation, the trees spreading and varying in size.  The water mills and other buildings are generally seen in the near distance, rather as the barn is here, and generally only one or two appear in each picture.  His compositions are carefully contrived and presumably imaginary, avoiding all symmetry.  This painting is a surprising break from most of these somewhat &quot;tired conventions of his earlier work&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Langmuir, 205&lt;/ref&gt; 

In contrast to his usual scenes of rough woodland, in this scene the straight lines, lopped trees, deep drainage ditches on both sides of the road, and regimented young trees in the plot to the right, all emphasize the man-made nature of this landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Loughman; Lörzing, 42–49&lt;/ref&gt;  A patch of rough woodland remains in the left foreground, contrasting with the [[sapling]]s in rows on the right.  The man tending to these is unusual in 17th-century Dutch landscapes, which rarely show anyone working the land.&lt;ref&gt;Loughman&lt;/ref&gt;  What brought Hobbema to this rather out-of-the-way location remains unknown.

In contrast to this accurate depiction of a specific place, it is thought that his compositions were usually assembled and painted in the studio from a number of different elements presumably recorded in drawings, and not all coming from the same place; there are often several versions changing parts of the composition.&lt;ref&gt;Loughman; Getty, 65&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Middelharnis Nederlands Hervormde Kerk 01.JPG|thumb|[[Middelharnis]] church tower in 2015]]

In 1668 he married and took the well-paid position of &quot;wine-gauger&quot; for the [[Amsterdam]] [[octroi]], assessing and collecting local taxes on wine, holding this until his death.  It is clear that his painting greatly reduced from this point, but it did not end completely, as used to be thought.  The quality of his work becomes uneven, though this is not the only very successful late work.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 206; MacLaren, 178&lt;/ref&gt;

Hofstede de Groot, like others at the time, believed Hobbema had completely stopped painting before the 1680s, and was sure the date read 1669.  Subsequent cleaning, and the discovery that the alder trees were only planted by the council in 1664, has confirmed that 1689 is the correct date.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 206–207&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
The unusually centralized composition carries the viewer's eye down the road, and the thin, very tall lopped trees unite the sky and the land.  The head of the gentleman with his dog is at a level with the [[vanishing point]] of the perspective, and very close to it.  He is a hunter, with a gun sloped over his shoulder, and a satchel for his game.&lt;ref&gt;Langmuir, 205–206; Slive, 206&lt;/ref&gt;  The &quot;dark patches of ground and vegetation to the left and right of the road echo and reinforce the horizon line and counteract the inward pull of the perspective.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Langmuir, 206&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980 [[x-ray radiography]] revealed that Hobbema had originally placed another tree in the foreground on each side of the avenue, but then painted these over.&lt;ref&gt;MacLaren, 177; illustrated in Vol II, figure 41&lt;/ref&gt;  Erica Langmuir suggests that the two additional trees at the front were painted over because Hobbema decided that they would have &quot;screened off the background from the foreground at the sides of the painting while exaggerating the 'rush' to the vanishing point in the centre.&quot;  She suggests testing this by holding pencils over a reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;Langmuir, 205&lt;/ref&gt;

For Seymour Slive the painting has &quot;the exalted spaciousness which often characterizes the Late Baroque, and also a kind of elegance in the elongated, slender trees that goes with the taste of this phase&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 207&lt;/ref&gt;

Though unusual, there had been a few previous compositions with &quot;a strongly foreshortened road lined with trees in a wide flat landscape&quot;. [[Aelbert Cuyp]] had painted  ''The Avenue at [[Meerdervoort]]'' in 1650–1652 (now in the [[Wallace Collection]]).

==Condition==
It was perhaps because the two painted-over trees in the foreground had begun to show through that the sky was extensively repainted in the 19th century.  This was realized in 1972 after analysis of the pigments used found synthetic [[ultramarine]] and [[chrome yellow]] in the sky, which had not yet been invented in the 1680s. A 19th-century restorer may have attempted to bring back the two trees, before thinking better of it, as Hobbema himself had done.&lt;ref&gt;MacLaren, 176–177&lt;/ref&gt;

The sky was largely repainted in 1951, much of which was removed in 1972, which &quot;gave the painting an unsatisfactory appearance&quot;, so in 1980–81 all the 1951 repainting was removed and new retouches added.  In contrast the landscape and trees are &quot;very well preserved&quot;, although the colour balance of the greens has probably altered to give a &quot;lighter and bluer shade of green than originally intended&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;MacLaren, 176–177&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
[[File:Camille Pissarro - The Avenue, Sydenham (1871).jpg|thumb|''The Avenue, Sydenham'' by [[Camille Pissarro]], painted in 1871, just after the National Gallery acquired the Hobbema]] 
Nearly a century after being painted it was still on the island, in a collection in nearby [[Sommelsdijk]], suggesting it had been commissioned by a local patron.&lt;ref&gt;MacLaren, 178.  Where it was painted is a different matter. Hobbema is thought to have normally painted up his works in his Amstedam studio, using drawings made on the scene, though very few survive.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the death of the collector in 1782 it was bought by the Middelharnis council and hung in the town hall until 1822. It was then exchanged with an obscure painter for a copy and another landscape painting, both by him. It then moved through the art trade, increasing rapidly in price, and reached [[Edinburgh]] in [[Scotland]] in 1826.&lt;ref&gt;MacLaren, 178&lt;/ref&gt;  Hobbema had been little appreciated and cheap in the 18th century, but his pictures were in tune with [[Romanticism|Romantic]] and later 19th-century taste, and prices rose accordingly through the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Loughman; Reitlinger, 338-229.  He records sales in Holland in 1815 for the equivalent of £90, and to Peel in 1829 for £840.  These do not exactly tally with the information in MacLaren.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1829 it was auctioned in Edinburgh for 195 [[Guinea (coin)|guineas]], already a good price, then taken to London and cleaned.&lt;ref&gt;MacLaren, 178; Reitlinger, 139&lt;/ref&gt; It then fetched £800, and by 1834 was in the collection of [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel, 2nd Baronet]], who had a significant collection of Dutch paintings, but is better known for having twice been [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] in 1834–1835 and 1841–1846. It was exhibited at the [[British Institution]] in 1835, and in March 1871 entered the National Gallery as NG 830 when they bought seventy-seven pictures and eighteen drawings from the Peel Collection.  These were bought from Peel's son [[Sir Robert Peel, 3rd Baronet|Robert, the 3rd Baronet]] for £75,000, with a special grant from the government,&lt;ref&gt;MacLaren, 178&lt;/ref&gt; and catalogued as NG 818 to 894.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/archive/record/NG5/440/3 NG Archive record]; &quot;Some works in the Peel Collection have been transferred to the British Museum, the National Portrait Gallery and the Tate Gallery&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; 

''The Avenue, Sydenham'' by [[Camille Pissarro]] was painted during a stay in London that ended in June 1871, a month after the National Gallery acquired the Hobbema, and its composition is probably influenced by it.&lt;ref&gt;Langmuir, 309–311&lt;/ref&gt;  Pissarro was then living in the London village, turning into a suburb, of [[Upper Norwood]], next to [[Sydenham]], avoiding the [[Franco-Prussian War]].  This painting is also now in the National Gallery.

'''''Stone City, Iowa''''' is a 1930 painting by the American artist [[Grant Wood]]. It depicts the former [[boomtown]] of [[Stone City, Iowa]]. It was Wood's first major landscape painting. It is a study of a real place with which Wood was thoroughly familiar, but the landscape has been given fantastical curvy shapes, the trees are ornamental, and the bright surfaces are artificially patterned.&lt;ref name=&quot;dennis&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dennis|first=James M.|year=1995|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GTvd44RgloMC&amp;pg=PA46|chapter=Grant Wood's Native-Born Modernism|title=Grant Wood: An American Master Revealed|location=|publisher=|p=46|isbn=0-87654-485-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The town had been built for its [[limestone]] quarries. When the painting was made, the town was in rapid decline due to the development of [[Portland cement]]. The painting thus depicts the transition from [[Industrialisation|industrialization]] and back to rural community. During the summers of 1932 and 1933, the town became the host of the [[Stone City Art Colony]], which Wood was part of.&lt;ref name=&quot;joslyn&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.joslyn.org/collections-and-exhibitions/permanent-collections/american/grant-wood-stone-city-iowa/|title=''Stone City, Iowa'' , 1930|publisher=[[Joslyn Art Museum]]|accessdate=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Stone City, Iowa'' was made the same year as Wood's ''[[American Gothic]]'' and both paintings were successes for the artist. Wood promoted his new style under the label of the &quot;new movement&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;dennis&quot; /&gt;

The painting is located at the [[Joslyn Art Museum]] in [[Omaha, Nebraska]].&lt;ref name=&quot;joslyn&quot; /&gt;

'''''Valley of the Yosemite''''' (or '''''Valley of the Yo-Semite''''') is a painting by [[Albert Bierstadt]] that was completed in 1864. Initially associated with the [[Hudson River School]], Bierstadt rose to prominence for his paintings of the [[Rocky Mountains]], which established him as one of the best painters of the western American landscape. His later paintings of Yosemite were also received with critical acclaim and public praise.

==Painting==
For his second trip West, in the summer of 1863, Bierstadt went with writer [[Fitz Hugh Ludlow]] to the [[West Coast of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/artist-info.6707.html |title=Artist Info |website=Nga.gov |date=1902-02-18 |accessdate=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the trip, Bierstadt spent several weeks doing [[en plein air]] studies in [[Yosemite Valley]]. Those studies were used as references for his future paintings, including this 1864 ''Valley of the Yosemite'', which was painted in his New York studio. Since this painting was on a smaller scale than his other larger panoramic scenes and it was done on paperboard, it is often thought that it is a sketch for his significantly larger, ''[[Looking Down Yosemite Valley, California]],'' which was painted a year later in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artsbma.org/january-2014-looking-down-yosemite-valley-california/ |title=Birmingham Museum of Art &amp;#124; » January 2014: Looking Down Yosemite Valley, California |website=Artsbma.org |date= |accessdate=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many versions of ''Valley of the Yosemite'' were painted by Bierstadt.

Upon viewing Yosemite, Albert Bierstadt immediately wrote to his friend, [[John Hay]], in August 1863, saying he discovered the [[Garden of Eden]] in America: Yosemite.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/valley-of-the-yosemite-33107 |title=Valley of the Yosemite &amp;#124; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston |website=Mfa.org |date=1947-06-12 |accessdate=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; With such thoughts of Paradise on his mind, Bierstadt painted an idealistic scene of the American wilderness, which he portrayed as completely untouched by man. Overall, the panoramic scene is idyllic, as a cluster of deer linger peacefully in the center foreground. A painter of the [[Hudson River School]], Bierstadt's style also had aspects of [[Luminism (American art style)|luminism]].  As seen in this depiction of Yosemite, the setting sun casts a yellow-orange glow over the entire landscape.&lt;ref name=&quot;frick1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalcollections.frick.org/digico/compare.html#258609f0-ec12-4fa1-8dff-977d9c077b7f |title=Mirador Viewer |website=Digitalcollections.frick.org |date= |accessdate=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Perhaps Bierstadt hoped to preserve this paradise through paintings like these, as a few years later, the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] was built, which introduced tourism to the American west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artgallery.yale.edu/collections/objects/4964 |title=Yosemite Valley, Glacier Point Trail |website=Artgallery.yale.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bierstadt's paintings, specifically ones with the Yosemite Valley as subject matter, resonated with many Americans as an untouched paradise during a time of unrest, as the [[American Civil War]] occurred. Furthermore, upon seeing these Yosemite-themed paintings, it spurred Americans to protect America's natural landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.clevelandart.org/art/221.1922|title=Yosemite Valley|date=24 June 2017|website=Clevelandart.org|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With public support, in 1864, [[President Abraham Lincoln]] signed a bill protecting Yosemite's natural beauty, preserving it as a park for the public to enjoy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Heuser |first=Stephen |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2009/06/june-30-1864-lincoln-creates-yosemite-park-024332 |title=June 30, 1864, Lincoln creates Yosemite Park |publisher=[[Politico]] |date=2009-06-30 |accessdate=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
Shortly after its completion, in April 1864, the painting was exhibited at the &quot;Metropolitan Fair, in aid of the United States Sanitary Commission.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/metropolitanfair01newy#page/8/mode/2up |title=Metropolitan fair, in aid of the United States sanitary commission |website=Archive.org |date=2010-07-21 |accessdate=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It sold for $1600, which was the highest price paid for any painting in the sale.  [[James Lenox]] bought it for his personal art collection. When construction for his [[Lenox Library (New York)]] ended, Lenox had the painting displayed in the art galleries. Years after Lenox's death, the Lenox Foundation decided to merge the Lenox Library's collection with the Tilden Trust and [[Astor Library]] to create the [[New York Public Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyarc.org/content/frick-remembering-lenox-library |title=Before The Frick: Remembering The Lenox Library &amp;#124; New York Art Resources Consortium |website=Nyarc.org |date=2016-08-04 |accessdate=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895, the painting belonged to the New York Public Library. However, in April 1943, the New York Public Library auctioned off the painting through Coleman Auction Galleries, and it was bought by Newhouse Galleries.&lt;ref name=&quot;frick1&quot;/&gt;  Soon after, A. F. Mondschein (also known as Frederick Mont or Adolf Fritz Mondschein or Frederick Mondschein) of New York acquired the painting. Mondschein was an art dealer and collector.  He primarily dealt with Old Masters paintings, which makes his involvement with Bierstadt's ''Valley of the Yosemite'' painting unusual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.frick.org/directoryweb/browserecord.php?-action=browse&amp;-recid=6126 |title=Mont, Frederick &amp;#124; Archives Directory for the History of Collecting |website=Research.frick.org |date= |accessdate=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mondschein then sold it later that year to [[Maxim Karolik]].  Karolik's wife, another prominent collector of American art, gifted the painting to the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] on June 12, 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;

'''''The Harvest Wagon''''' is the name of two paintings by the English artist [[Thomas Gainsborough]]. The first was done around 1767 and is today owned by the [[Barber Institute of Fine Arts]], in [[Birmingham, England]]. The later painting was done around 1784 and is part of the collection of the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]]. The later painting is the better known of the two. It was donated to the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]] by [[Frank P Wood]]. It is one of the most prominent pieces in the collection of the AGO.&lt;ref&gt;John Bentley Mays. &quot;Back to the land with Turner and Gainsborough.&quot; ''The Globe and Mail.'' Toronto, Ont.: Jul 29, 1995. pg. C.16&lt;/ref&gt; 

Both paintings depict a group of peasants riding inside a simple wagon through a rural landscape with a collection of nearby animals. A young boy leads the wagon, while a man helps lift a young woman aboard. The painting is set in the area around Gainsborough's adopted city of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], where he lived for 14 years of his life. In 1995 the two museums collaborated on a joint show that displayed the two versions side by side, first on display in England and then in Canada.  

The two paintings of a similar subject done some seventeen years apart show the evolution of Gainsborough as an artist. The later painting is more sedate, the figures more composed and less excited. The Gainsborough scholar Hugh Besley sees landscape, people, and animals as more unified in the later work. He also sees more influence of Rubens on Gainsborough's style and technique, particularly of Rubens's ''[[The Descent from the Cross (Rubens)|The Descent from the Cross]]''. The woman ascending to the wagon shows a motion opposite to Christ's. Christina Payne has commented on some of the symbolism in the 1784 work, noting that the broken pitcher placed in front of the pregnant passenger may be a symbol of virginity.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Besley. &quot;Gainsborough's Harvest Wagons: Toronto and Birmingham.&quot; ''[[The Burlington Magazine]]'' Vol. 137, No. 1109 (Aug., 1995), pp. 574-575.&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier painting is also far more intimate to the artist as the women in the wagon are portraits of Gainsborough's own daughters, Mary and Margaret.&lt;ref&gt;Meryle Secrest. ''Duveen: A Life in Art.'' University of Chicago Press, 2004 pg. 297&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first work could not find a buyer, perhaps being too ribald for the art market of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Short ''The English Rural Community: Image and Analysis.'' CUP Archive, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;  It was given to Gainsborough's friend Wiltshire, a mover who transported Gainsborough's paintings from Bath to exhibitions in London. Wiltshire's horses had also served as the model of the animals in the picture. The painting remained in Wiltshire's family until his grandson sold it in 1867.

The second painting, done at the height of Gainsborough's fame, was sold to the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]], later to become King George IV. It later became part of the collection of American steel magnate [[Elbert Henry Gary]]. Upon Gary's death in 1927 his collection was auctioned off, and ''The Harvest Wagon'' was one of the most sought-after works.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,786363,00.html Art: Gary's Gainsborough]&quot; ''Time'' Apr. 30, 1928&lt;/ref&gt; After a competitive auction it was purchased by art dealer [[Joseph Duveen, 1st Baron Duveen|Joseph Duveen]] for $360,000, then the highest price ever paid at auction for a painting in the United States. Duveen later sold it to Canadian art collector [[Frank P. Wood]] for $450,000, and Wood then donated it to the Art Gallery of Ontario. In 1959 the painting was somewhat damaged during an attempted robbery when the thieves tried to cut the painting out of its frame.&lt;ref&gt; Hugh McLeave ''Rogues in the Gallery: The Modern Plague of Art Thefts'' C&amp;M Online Media, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Caspar David Friedrich - Der einsame Baum - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Caspar David Friedrich]], ''The lonely tree'' (''Der einsame Baum''), 1822, Alte Nationalgalerie, Berlin]]

'''''The Lonely Tree''''' (German: ''Der einsame Baum'') is an 1822 oil-on-canvas painting by German painter [[Caspar David Friedrich]].  It measures {{convert|55|xx|71|cm}}.  The work depicts a panoramic view of a [[Romanticism|romantic]] landscape of plains with mountains in the background.  A solitary [[oak]] tree dominates the foreground.  

An ancient oak stands at the centre of the painting, clearly damaged but still standing.  The tree's branches, dark in silhouette, project into the largely overcast morning sky.  Banks of cloud seem to form a dome above the tree.  The crown of the tree is dead, and the top of its trunk and two truncated branches resemble a cross.  A shepherd shelters under the leaf-bearing lower branches.  His flock of sheep graze beside a pond in the wide grassy meadow around the tree.  In the middle distance, villages and a town nestle among other trees and bushes.  Tree-clad hills pile up into blue-grey mountains in the background.

The work was commissioned by banker and art collector [[Joachim Heinrich Wilhelm Wagener]], together with a second painting ''[[Moonrise by the Sea]]'' (''Mondaufgang am Meer'') to create a pair of &quot;times of the day&quot;, depicting morning and evening landscape scenes, in a tradition of [[Claude Lorrain]].  It was completed before November 1822 and has been held by the [[Berlin National Gallery]] since 1861, donated by Wagener as part of its founding collection.  It is now in the [[Alte Nationalgalerie]] of the [[Staatliche Museen]] in Berlin.

Art historian [[Helmut Börsch-Supan]] has suggested that the mountains are in the [[Riesengebirge]], now in the [[Czech Republic]], which historically divided [[Silesia]] and [[Bohemia]], southeast of [[Dresden]], where Friedrich settled in 1798.  Friedrich painted the mountains several times between 1806 and 1810.   The double peak may be [[Jeschken]].

The painting has drawn a number of interpretations.  [[Ludwig Justi]] sees the old oak as a symbol of the German people, rooted in the landscape; [[Jens Christian Jensen]] sees it as a link between the past and the present; and [[Charlotte Margarethe de Prybram-Gladona]] sees it as a symbol of loneliness.
