Cairn in Snow

Cairn in Snow () is a landscape painting by Caspar David Friedrich. It was created in 1807. The painting is a Romantic allegorical landscape, showing what appears to be a Neolithic burial site among three oaks, near the town Gützkow in Germany. The painter depicts barren trees in the snow, giving the work a haunted, spectral air. With its contemplative melancholy mood, the painting transmits a Romantic view of nature. 

Trees and forests were seen as symbols of life endurance, longevity, and immortality. Sacred groves, often a group of trees in ancient times, were associated with secrecy and initiation rites, and they were regarded as untouchable. The main trees depicted in this painting by Friedrich appear to have had most of their old branches chopped off.

Today the painting is in the Galerie Neue Meister in Dresden. Originally, it was owned by the Greifswald University professor Karl Schildener. The painting is described in 1828 in the "Greifswald academical journal" (II, 2, pp. 40–41). Friedrich is noted for his landscapes depicting features silhouetted against the sky, morning mists, or Gothic ruins. This work is one of his earliest oil paintings.
